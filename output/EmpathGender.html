Tonight, I am so thrilled and so honored and so proud to introduce the love of my life \u2014 ", "Thank you. It is a singular honor to be here tonight. Eight years ago in Boston, I introduced you to a state senator from Illinois. \nI was there \u2014 I was there \u2014Four more years! Now, I was there \u2014Many of you were with me. It was a cold, cold January afternoon when Barack Obama lifted his hand from Abraham Lincoln's Bible and looked out on an America facing an economic collapse. These last four years have been hard. Too many families are still struggling. But today our economy is beginning to recover. Jobs are returning; businesses are expanding. America is coming back. \nOur friends \u2014 our friends in the other party gathered in Tampa and gave us a message last week.\nThey said, just remember, we're all in this alone. Yeah.\nThey told us, the real winners \u2014 the real builders \u2014 never need a helping hand.\nDemocrats know better; America knows better. History and this president have shown us we are stronger when we are all in this together. \nI invite them: Come to Belvidere, Illinois. Meet 5,000 proud Chrysler UAW workers. \nCome and meet the working families all across America who now have a chance for affordable health care. At one time, a governor thought that was a good idea in Massachusetts. Well, President Obama and millions of American families think it's a great idea for America.But this president is focused on more than just opportunity. He is focused on justice. I am proud to have been there when he signed his first bill as president of the United States to end discrimination against women in the workplace in honor of Lilly Ledbetter. \nAnd I will tell you, I cannot remember a more touching ceremony than when this president gathers together to finally eliminate the discrimination of \"don't ask, don't tell\" in our military. \nIt was 11 years ago. \nEleven years ago I introduced a little bill known as the DREAM Act. \nIt was 150 years ago \u2014 150 years ago that another president from Illinois brought justice to his day with the Emancipation Proclamation. Now, his critics told him he had gone way too far and he should undo what he'd done. But here's what Abraham Lincoln said: \"I hope to stand firm enough not to go backwards.\" \nWe cannot \u2014 we cannot build a better, stronger, fairer America by going backwards. We must walk forward together. And with President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden in the White House, we will. President Obama, your values, your vision, your commitment to justice are still worth fighting for.\nThank you. ", "Hey, Delaware. \nAnd my favorite Democrat, Jilly, I want you to know that Beau and Hunt and Ashley and I \u2014 we're so incredibly proud of you, kid. You know, we admire the way \u2014 they way that when every single solitary young person \u2014 and they're not all young \u2014 walk into your classroom, you not only teach them, you give them confidence.\nYou give me confidence. And the passion \u2014 the passion she brings to trying to ease the burden on the families of our warriers. Jilly, they know you understand them. And that makes a gigantic difference. \nAnd folks, I tell you what, it was worth the trip to hear my wife say what I've never heard her say before: She's always loved me. \nWe've got three incredible kids. And Beau, I want to thank you for putting my name in nomination to be vice president of the United States. \nThank you, my fellow Democrats. \nAnd I say to my fellow Americans: My fellow Americans, four years ago a battered nation turned away from the failed policies of the past and turned to a leader who they knew would lift our nation out of the crisis \u2014 a journey \u2014 a journey we haven't finished yet. We know we still have more to do. But today I say to my fellow citizens: In the face of the deepest economic crisis in our lifetime, this generation of Americans has proven itself as worthy as any generation before us. \u2014 a mission we will complete.\nFolks, tonight what I really want to do is tell you about my friend Barack Obama. But I know him, to state the obvious, from a different perspective.\nI know him, and I want to show you \u2014 I want to show you the character of a leader who had what it took when the American people literally stood on the brink of a new depression, a leader who has what it takes to lead us over the next four years to a future as great as our people. I want to take you inside the White House to see the president as I see him every day, because I don't see him in soundbites. I walk 30 paces down the hall into the Oval Office, and I see him, I watch him in action.\nFour years ago the middle class was already losing ground, and then the bottom fell out. The financial crisis hit like a sledgehammer on all the people I grew up with. You remember the headlines. You saw some of them in the previews. Highlight: Highest job losses in 60 years. Headlines: Economy on the brink; markets plummet worldwide.\nFrom the very moment President Obama sat behind the desk, resolute, in the Oval Office, he knew \u2014 he knew he had not only to restore the confidence of a nation, but he had to restore the confidence of the whole world. And he also knew \u2014 he also knew that one, one false move could bring a run on the banks or a credit collapse to put another several million people out of work. America and the world needed a strong president with a steady hand and with the judgment and vision to see us through.\nDay after day, night after night I sat beside him as he made one gutsy decision after the other to stop the slide and reverse it. I watched him. I watched him stand up. I watched him stand up to intense pressure and stare down enormous, enormous challenges, the consequences of which were awesome.\nBut most of all, I got to see firsthand what drove this man: his profound concern for the average American. He knew \u2014 he knew that no matter how tough the decisions he had to make were in that Oval Office, he knew that families all over America sitting at their kitchen tables were literally making decisions for their family that were equally as consequential.\nYou know, Barack and I, we've been through a lot together these four years, and we learned about one another, a lot about one another. And one of the things I learned about Barack is the enormity of his heart. And I think he learned about me the depth of my loyalty to him. \nAnd there's another thing, another thing that has bound us together these past four years. We had a pretty good idea what all those families, all you Americans in trouble were going through, in part because our own families had gone through similar struggles.\nBarack as a young man had to sit at the end of his mother's hospital bed and watch her fight with her insurance company at the very same time she was fighting for her life.\nWhen I was a young kid in third grade, I remember my dad coming up the stairs in my grandpop's house where we were living, sitting at the end of my bed, and saying, Joey, I'm going to have to leave for a while. Gone \u2014 go down to Wilmington, Delaware, with Uncle Franks. They're good jobs down there, honey. And in a little while \u2014 a little while, I'll be able to send for you and mom and Jimmy and Val, and everything's going to be fine.\nFor the rest of our life, my sister and my brothers, for the rest of our life, dad never failed to remind us that a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about \u2014 \nWhen Barack and I \u2014 when Barack and I were growing up, there was an implicit understanding in America that if you took responsibility, you'd get a fair shot at a better life. And the values \u2014 the values behind that bargain were the values that shaped both of us, and many, many of you. And today those same values are Barack's guiding star. Folks, I've watched him. He has never wavered.\nHe never, never backs down. He always steps up, and he always asks in every one of those critical meetings the same fundamental question: How is this going to affect the average American? How is this going to affect people's lives? That's what's inside this man. That's what makes him tick. That's who he is.\nAnd folks, because of the decisions he has made, and the incredible strength of the American people, America has turned a corner. The worst job loss since the Great Depression, we've since created 4.5 million private sector jobs in the past 25 \u2014 29 months. \nLook, folks. President Obama and Governor Romney, they're both \u2014 they're both loving husbands. They're both devoted fathers. But let's be straight. They bring a vastly different vision and a vastly different values set to the job. \nAnd tonight \u2014 tonight, although you've heard people talk about it, I want to talk about two things from a slightly different perspective, from my perspective. I'd like to focus on two crises and show you \u2014 show you the character of leadership that each man will bring to this job, because as I said, I've had a ringside seat. The first of these a lot's been talked about.\nAnd God love Jennifer Granholm. Wasn't she great? \nBut the first story I want to talk to you about is the rescue of the automobile industry. And let me tell you \u2014 let me tell you \u2014 from this man's ringside seat, let me tell you about how Barack Obama saved more than a million American jobs. In the first \u2014 in the first days, literally the first days that we took office, General Motors and Chrysler were literally on the verge of liquidation. If the president didn't act, if he didn't act immediately, there wouldn't be any industry left to save.\nSo we sat hour after hour in the Oval Office. Michelle remembers how it must have \u2014 what he must have thought when she \u2014 he came back upstairs. We sat. We sat hour after hour. We listened to senators, congressmen, outside advisers, even some of our own adviser , and we listened to them to say some of the following things. They said, well, we shouldn't step up. The risk \u2014 the risk was too high. The outcome was too uncertain.\nAnd the president, he patiently sat there and he listened. But he didn't see it the way they did. He understood something they didn't get. And one of the reasons I love him, he understood that this wasn't just about cars. It was about the people who built and made those cars \u2014 \nIn those meetings \u2014 \u2014 in those meetings \u2014 in those meetings, I often thought about my dad. My dad was an automobile man. He would have been one of those guys all the way down the line, not on the factory floor, not along the supply chain, but one of those guys who were selling American cars to American people.\nI thought about \u2014 I thought about what this crisis would have meant for the mechanics and the secretaries and the salespeople who my dad managed for over 35 years. And I know for certain \u2014 I know for certain that my dad, were he here today, he'd be fighting like heck for the president, because the president fought to save the jobs of those people my dad cared so much about. \u2014 my dad respected Barack Obama \u2014 would have respected Barack Obama, had he been around, for having had the guts to stand up for the automobile industry when so many others just were prepared to walk away.\nYou know, when I look back \u2014 \u2014 when I look back now, when I look back on the president's decision, I think of another son of another automobile man, Mitt Romney. Mitt \u2014 no, no \u2014 Mitt Romney \u2014 Mitt Romney grew up in Detroit. My dad managed, his dad owned \u2014 well, his dad ran an entire automobile company, American Motors. Yes, what I don't understand is in spite of that, he was willing to let the \u2014 Detroit go bankrupt.No, don't. I don't think he's a bad guy. No, no. I don't think he's a bad guy. I'm sure he grew up loving cars as much as I did. But what I don't understand, what I don't think he understood, I don't think he understood that saving the automobile worker, saving the industry, what it meant to all of America, not just autoworkers. I think he saw it the Bain way. Now, I mean this sincerely. I think he saw it in terms of balance sheets and write-offs.\nFolks, the Bain way may bring your firm the highest profits. But it's not the way to lead our country from the highest office. \nWhen things \u2014 when things \u2014 when things hung in the balance \u2014 when things hung in the balance \u2014 I mean, literally hung in the balance \u2014 the president understood this was about a lot more than the automobile industry. This was about restoring America's pride. He understood \u2014 he understood in his gut what it would mean to leave a million people without hope or work if he didn't act. And he also knew \u2014 he also knew \u2014 he intuitively understood the message it would have sent around the world if the United States gave up on an industry that helped put America on the map in the first place. \nLook, you heard my friend John Kerry. This president \u2014 this president has shown the same resolve, the same steady hand in his role as commander in chief. Look \u2014 which brings me to the next illustration I want to tell you about, the next crisis he had to face. In 2008 \u2014 2008, before he was president \u2014 Barack Obama made a promise to the American people.\nHe said, if I have bin \u2014 if we have bin Laden in our sights, we will \u2014 we will take him out. \nHe went on to say \u2014 he went on to say, that has to be our biggest national security priority.\nLook, Barack understood that the search for bin Laden was about a lot more than taking a monstrous leader off the battlefield. It was about so much more than that. It was about righting an unspeakable wrong. It was about \u2014 literally, it was about \u2014 it was about healing an unbearable wound, a nearly unbearable wound in America's heart.\nAnd he also knew \u2014 he also knew the message we had to send around the world: If you attack innocent Americans, we will follow you to the end of the earth. \nLook \u2014Most of all \u2014 most of all, President Obama had an unyielding faith in the capacity and the capability of our special forces, literally the finest warriors in the history of the world. The finest warriors in the history of the world.\nSo we sat. We sat originally \u2014 only five of us \u2014 we sat in the Situation Room beginning in the fall of the year before. We listened, we talked, we heard, and he listened to the risks and reservations about the raid. He asked again the tough questions. He listened to the doubts that were expressed.\nBut when Admiral McRaven looked him in the eye and said, sir, we can get this job done, I sat next to him and looked at your husband, and I knew at that moment he had made his decision. And his response was decisive. He said, do it \u2014 and justice was done! \nFolks, folks \u2014Folks, Governor Romney didn't see things that way. When he was asked about bin Laden in 2007, here's what he said. He said, it's not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars just to catch one person. \nBut he was wrong. He was wrong. Because if you understood that America's heart had to be healed, you would have done exactly what the president did and you would move heaven and earth to hunt him down and to bring him to justice. \nLook, four years ago \u2014 four years ago \u2014 the only thing missing at this convention this year is my mom. Four years ago my mom was still with us, sitting up in the stadium in Denver. I quoted her.\nI quoted her, one of her favorite expressions. She used to say to all her children \u2014 she said, Joey, bravery resides in every heart, and the time will come when it must be summoned.\nLadies and gentlemen, I'm here to tell you what I think you already know. But I watch it up close. Bravery resides in the heart of Barack Obama, and time and time again I witnessed him summon it. That's right. One man.\nFolks, we know \u2014 we know we have more work to do. We know we're not there yet. But not a day has gone by in the last four years when I haven't been grateful as an American that Barack Obama is our president because he always has the courage to make the tough decisions. \nSpeaking of tough decisions \u2014 speaking of tough calls \u2014 \u2014 last week we heard at the Republican convention \u2014 we heard our opponents \u2014 we heard them pledge that they too \u2014 they too heard the courage to make the tough calls.\nThat's what they said. \nBut folks, in case you didn't notice \u2014 \nThey \u2014 Mrs. Robinson, you \u2014 you watched from home, I guess, from the White House. You heard them talk so much about how they cared so much about Medicare, how much they wanted to preserve it. That's what they told you.\nBut let's look at what they didn't tell you. What they didn't tell you is that the plan they have already put down on paper would immediately cut benefits for more than 30 million seniors already on Medicare. What they didn't tell you \u2014 what they didn't tell you is the plan they're proposing would cause Medicare to go bankrupt by 2016. And what they really didn't tell you is they \u2014 if you want to know \u2014 if you want to know \u2014 they're not for preserving Medicare at all. They're for a new plan. It's called \"Vouchercare.\" \nLook, folks. That's not courage. That's not even truthful. That's not even truthful. In Tampa, they talk with great urgency about the nation's debt and the need to act, to act now. But not once, not one single time, did they tell you that they rejected every plan put forward by us, by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission they referenced \u2014 \u2014 or by any other respected group to reduce the national debt.\nThey are not for any of them. Why? Because they're not prepared to do anything about the debt if it contained even one dollar \u2014 I'm not exaggerating \u2014 even one dollar or one cent in new taxes for millionaires.\nFolks, that's not courage and that's not fair. \nLook \u2014 look. In a sense, this can be reduced to a single notion. The two men seeking to lead this country over the next four years, as I said at the outset, have fundamentally different visions and a completely different value set.\nGovernor Romney believes in this global economy \u2014 it doesn't matter much where American companies invest and put their money or where they create jobs. As a matter of fact, in his budget proposal, in his tax proposal, he calls for a new tax. It's called a territorial tax, which the experts have looked at, and they acknowledge it will create 800,000 new jobs \u2014 all of them overseas, all of them. \nAnd what I've found \u2014 what I found fascinating, the most fascinating thing I found last week was when Governor Romney said that as president, he would take a jobs tour. Well, with his support for outsourcing, it's going to have to be a foreign trip. It will.\nLook, President Obama knows that creating jobs in America, keeping jobs in America, bringing jobs back to America is what the president's job was all about.\nThat's what presidents do, or at least supposed to do. \nFolks, Governor Romney believes it's OK to raise taxes on middle classes by $2,000 in order to pay for another \u2014 literally another trillion-dollar tax cut for the very wealthy. President Obama knows that there's nothing decent or fair about asking people with more to do less and with less to do more. \nGovernor Romney believes \u2014 he believes that kids, kids like our \"DREAMers\" \u2014 those immigrant children \u2014 \nGovernor Romney \u2014 Governor Romney \u2014 Governor Romney \u2014 Governor Romney looks at the notion of equal pay in terms of a company's bottom line. President Obama \u2014 he knows that making sure our daughters get the same pay for the same jobs as our son is every father's bottom line. \nLook, I kind of expected all that from him. But one thing truly perplexed me at their convention. The thing that perplexed me most was this idea they kept talking about about the culture of dependency. They seem to think you create a culture of dependency when you provide a bright, young, qualified kid from a working-class family a loan to get to college or when you provide a job training program in a new industry for a dad who lost his job because it was outsourced.\nFolks \u2014 folks, that's not how we look at it. That's not how America's ever looked at it. \nLook \u2014 and it literally amazes me they don't understand that. You know, I told you the outset the choice is stark, two different visions, two different value sets. But at its core, the difference is able to reduced \nAs I mentioned at the outset, four years ago we were hit hard. You saw \u2014 you saw your retirement accounts drain, the equity in your homes vanish, jobs lost around the line. But what did you do as Americans? What you've always done. You didn't lose faith. You fought back. You didn't give up; you got up. \nFolks, there's one more thing, one more thing our Republican opponents are just dead wrong about. America is not in decline. America is not in decline. Never!\nMy fellow Americans, America is coming back. And we're not going back. And we have no intention of downsizing the American dream. Never. Never a good bet.\nLadies and gentlemen, in a moment \u2014 in a moment we're going to hear from a man whose whole life is a testament to the power of that dream and whose presidency is the best hope to secure that dream for our children. For you see \u2014 you see, we see a future \u2014 we really honest to God do \u2014 we see a future where everyone, rich and poor, does their part and has a part, a future where we depend more on clean energy from home and less on oil from abroad, a future where we're number one in the world again in college graduation, a future where we promote the private sector, not the privileged sector \u2014 \nAnd ladies and gentlemen, Barack and I see a future \u2014 it's in our DNA \u2014 where no one, no one is forced to live in the shadows of intolerance. \nFolks, we see a future where American \u2014 where America leads not only by the power of our \u2014 the example of our power, but by the power of example, where we bring our troops home from Afghanistan just as we proudly did from Iraq \u2014 \u2014 a future \u2014 a future where we fulfill the only truly sacred obligation we have as a nation. The only truly sacred obligation we have is to prepare those who we send to war and care for them when they come home from war.\nAnd tonight \u2014 \u2014 and tonight \u2014 tonight I want to acknowledge \u2014 I want to acknowledge, as we should every night, the incredible debt we owe to the families of those 6,473 fallen angels and those 49,746 wounded, thousands critically, thousands who will need our help for the rest of their lives.\nFolks, we never \u2014 we must never, ever forget their sacrifice and always keep them in our care and in our prayers.\nMy fellow Americans, we now \u2014 we now \u2014 and we now find ourselves at the hinge of history. And the direction we turn is not figuratively, is literally in your hands. It has been a truly great honor to serve you and to serve with Barack, who has always stood up with you for the past four years. I've seen him tested. I know his strength, his command, his faith. And I also know the incredible confidence he has in all of you. I know this man. Yes, the work of recovery is not yet \u2014 not yet complete. But we are on our way. The journey of hope is not yet finished, but we are on our way. \nSo I say to you tonight with absolute confidence, America's best days are ahead, and yes, we are on our way. \nGod bless you all, and may God protect our troops. ", "Hello. \nThank you, Angie. I'm so proud of how far you've come.\nI'm so proud to stand before you tonight not only as the wife of our vice president but as a full-time teacher and a military mom. \nFour years ago Beau stood on this stage to introduce his father, and soon afterwards he deployed to Iraq for a year with the Delaware Army National Guard. Tonight, thanks to the leadership of President Obama and my husband, Joe, the war in Iraq is over.\n\nI'm also \u2014 I'm also here tonight for my students, students like Angie \nNot long \u2014 not long after Joe was elected vice president, people started questioning whether I could keep teaching. Not Joe. He was there standing by my side saying, of course you should; it's who you are, Jill. For me, being a teacher isn't just what I do; it's who I am. These issues are personal to me, and for the more than 37 years that I've known Joe, I've seen firsthand just how personal they are to him too.\nJoe often tells people that I didn't agree to marry him until the fifth time he asked me. The truth is, I loved him from the start. I saw in him then the same character that I see in him today. I've seen Joe's character in his optimism. For families who have lost a loved one, kids struggling to find their way, workers out of a job, Joe always works to give people a sense of hope.\n\nI've also seen Joe's character in his determination. Two decades ago when Joe started working on the Violence Against Women Act \u2014 \nFinally, I've seen Joe's character in his heart. When I first met him, Joe had already seen just how fragile life could be. When he was 29 years old, Joe lost his first wife and baby daughter in a tragic car accident while they were out getting their Christmas tree. And their boys were critically injured. Joe's life was shattered. But through his strong Catholic faith and his fierce love for our boys, Joe found the strength to get back up. That's Joe. \nThat optimism, that determination, that big strong heart that drives him forward every day \u2014 it's what he learned as a young boy growing up with two hardworking parents in Scranton, Pennsylvania. It's what makes him such a loving and supportive father of our three children, Beau, Hunter and Ashley, and it's what drives him today as he and President Obama fight to strengthen the middle class they grew up in.\nFor as long as I've known him, Joe has never given up, never failed to see the possibilities and never had any doubt about who he's fighting for. And as long as he has the privilege of serving this nation, I know from the bottom of my heart that he will continue to fight for you every day. Thank you. God bless our troops, and God bless our military families. Thank you!", "My name is Angie Flores and I am a student at Miami-Dade College. \nWhen you grow up in a family where getting by is a struggle, college can seem like a dream for someone else, even if, like me, you love learning. Out of 3.2 million young people ages 16 to 24, 2.2 million do not go to college. More than a million don't even graduate from high school.\nThe statistics say that I shouldn't be here; that the most someone like me should hope for is to get by, not to get ahead.\nBut I am not a statistic. I am a young woman with a bright future.\nPresident Obama and Vice President Biden know this. They don't want any American student to accept that education is only a luxury or that opportunity is simply for someone else. They ask us to work hard and dream big. And they work alongside us to make sure that those dreams come true. We all aspire to live that ideal middle-class lifestyle with the picket fence and the lemonade on the porch. And President Obama and Vice President Biden are helping kids like me build that dream. We all celebrate success. President Obama and Vice President Biden help us achieve it. \nWe all know that education leads to opportunity and that education begins with a great teacher in every classroom. Tonight I have the honor of introducing an extraordinary educator. A lot of people know Dr. Jill Biden as our nation's second lady. \nLast year I had the distinct pleasure to meet Dr. Biden. I am fortunate to have teachers like her at Miami Dade College. She is full of warmth, compassion and dedication. And that's how she makes a difference for students like me.\nA teacher like Dr. Biden can make the difference between being a statistic and being a success, between getting by and getting ahead. And that is why \u2014 and that is why I am studying to work with children. When I look at Dr. Jill Biden, I see someone making the kinds of impact that I want to make.\nSo please join me in welcoming my role model, Dr. Jill Biden. ", "Today and every day, our military men and women serve our country with their actions and their deeds. The veterans standing with me \u2014 all veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan \u2014 are part of a proud legacy.\nFor those who defended us in the earliest days of our country to the greatest generation of World War II, for those who served and sacrificed in Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf War, the Balkans, anywhere they've been needed, today's servicemen and women have been called \"the next great generation,\" and they live up to that calling in everything they do. They've gone beyond the call of duty in every way one can imagine.\nI served the United States Navy for 37 years as a fighter pilot, as commander of Naval Air Forces and as vice chief of the Navy. I've heard plenty of folks thank us for our service. We appreciate that gratitude. And since the day he took office, the president has demonstrate that he respects and understands the challenges for those who wear a uniform.\nFor every branch of the service, for those in civilian clothes or the uniform, President Obama gives us a foreign policy worthy of the men and women on this stage \u2014 \u2014 to ensure \u2014 to ensure that wherever they serve, their uniform and dedication is respected and that their service makes a difference for America.\nFor every veteran who comes home wounded, the president invested in the VA and expanded care to more than a half-million returning troops who deserve that care. For every family waiting at home, anxious every time the phone rings, the president, the first lady and Dr. Jill Biden are engaging whole communities to support those families. For every man and woman coming back to an uncertain future, the president strives to help veterans apply their talents, expand their skills and get good jobs.\n\nLast year he challenged American businesses to hire 100,000 veterans and military spouses. He and the first lady got businesses across the private sector to sign on, supported by tax credits for hiring our veterans and wounded warriors. Last month these same participating businesses reported that they exceeded that goal by 25 percent, ahead of schedule by almost a year \u2014 \nAnd it's just \u2014 and it's not just about finding new jobs. It's about giving these men and women the chance to learn the skills for the jobs tomorrow. That's why I'm proud that the president is offering veterans the best education benefits since the original GI Bill. \nMy parents \u2014 my parents were members of the greatest generation. My dad joined the Army Air Corps in 1940 as an enlisted man fixing bombers in World War II. He served a career in the Strategic Air Command. My mother was a volunteer for the USO, and later, as a widow, she raised five children.\nIn the years since, I've been privileged to lead and serve with members of this next great generation. I see in them tough, bright, courageous, inspiring men and women. I see this country's future leaders. These service members have been to some of the bleakest corners of the globe. They know how good this country is. They know firsthand what America means to \u2014 world \u2014 they're \u2014 and they're going to bring to us the next great moment in our nation's history because the president is standing with them. \nTonight we are standing here with you. We are standing with our president. The men and women on this stage are only a small sample of this amazing generation \u2014 Americans from Texas \u2014 ", "Thank you. Thank you.\nIn this \u2014 in this campaign, we have a fundamental choice. Will we protect our country and our allies, advance our interests and ideals, do battle where we must and make peace where we can, or will we entrust our place in the world to someone who just hasn't learned the lessons of the last decade?\nWe've all learned Mitt Romney doesn't know much about foreign policy, but he has all these neocon advisers who know all the wrong things about foreign policy. He would rely on them. After all, he's the great outsourcer. \nBut I say to you, this is not the time to outsource the job of commander in chief. Our opponents \u2014 our opponents like to talk about American exceptionalism, but all they do is talk.\nThey forget that we are exceptional not because we say we are but because we do exceptional things. \nDespite \u2014 and despite \u2014 and despite what you heard in Tampa, an exceptional country does care about the rise of the oceans and the future of the planet. That is a responsibility \u2014 that is a responsibility from the Scriptures. And that too is a responsibility of the leader of the free world.\nThe only thing exceptional about today's Republicans is that almost without exception, they oppose everything that has made America exceptional in the first place. An exceptional nation demands exceptional leadership. It demands the leadership of an exceptional president. And my fellow Americans, that president is Barack Obama. \nNow, just measure the disaster and disarray that he inherited. A war of choice in Iraq had become a war without end, and a war of necessity in Afghanistan had become a war of neglect. Our alliances were shredded. Our moral authority was in tatters. America was isolated in the world. Our military was stretched to the breaking point, Iran marching towards a nuclear weapon unchecked, and Osama bin Laden was still plotting.\nIt took President Obama to make America lead like America again.\nIt took President Obama to restore our moral authority. It took President Obama to ban torture. The president understands that our values don't limit our power; they magnify it. He showed that global leadership is a strategic imperative for America, not a favor that we do to other countries.\nAnd President Obama kept his promises. He promised to end the war in Iraq, and he has, and our heroes have come home. \nAnd after more than \u2014 after more than 10 years without justice for thousands of Americans murdered on 9/11, after Mitt Romney said it would be naive to go into Pakistan to pursue the terrorists, it took President Obama, against the advice of many, to give that order and finally rid this earth of Osama bin Laden. \nBarack Obama \u2014 Barack Obama promised always to stand with Israel, to tighten sanctions on Iran and take nothing off the table.\nAgain and again, the other side has lied about where this president stands and what this president has done. But Prime Minister Netanyahu set the record straight. He said, our two countries have exactly the same policy; our security cooperation is unprecedented. And when it comes to Israel, my friends, I'll take the word of Israel's prime minister over Mitt Romney any day. \nPresident Obama promised to work with Russia to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons and signed an historic treaty that does just that. He promised to lock down nuclear materials around the world, and he has done just that. He refused to accept the false choice between force without diplomacy and diplomacy without force. When a brutal dictator promised to hunt down and kill his own people like rats, President Obama enlisted our allies, built the coalition, shared the burden so that today, without a single American casualty, Moammar Gadhafi is gone, and the people of Libya are free. \nSo on one side \u2014 so on one side of this campaign, we have a president who has made America lead like America again. And what is there on the other side? An extreme and expedient candidate who lacks the judgment and the vision so vital to the Oval Office, the most inexperienced foreign policy twosome to run for president and vice president in decades.\n\nHe was against setting a date for withdrawal. Then he said it was right. And then he left the impression that maybe it was wrong to leave this soon. He said it was tragic to leave Iraq. And then he said it was fine. He said we should have intervened in Libya sooner. Then he ran down a hallway to run away from the reporters who were asking questions. Then he said the intervention was too aggressive. And then he said the world was a better place because the intervention succeeded.\nTalk about being for it before you were against it! \nMr. Romney \u2014 Mr. Romney \u2014 Mr. Romney, here's a little advice. Before you debate Barack Obama on foreign policy, you better finish the debate with yourself. \nNow with President Mitt Romney \u2014 President Mitt Romney \u2014 \nYou know, it wasn't \u2014 it wasn't a goodwill mission, it was a blooper reel. \nBut a Romney-Ryan foreign policy would be anything but funny.\nEvery president of both parties for 60 years has worked for nuclear arms control, but not Mitt Romney. Republican secretaries of state, from Kissinger to Baker, Powell to Rice, President Bush, 71 United States senators all supported President Obama's New START treaty, but not Mitt Romney.\nHe's even blurted out the preposterous notion that Russia is our number-one political \u2014 geopolitical foe. Folks, Sarah Palin said she could see Russia from Alaska. Mitt Romney talks like he's only seen Russia by watching \"Rocky IV\"!\nI'll tell you, so here's the choice \u2014 here's the choice in 2012. Mitt Romney, out of touch at home, out of his depth abroad and out of the mainstream, or Barack Obama, a president who is giving new life and truth to America's indispensable role in the world \u2014 a commander in chief who gives our troops the tools and training they need in war, the honor and help they have earned when they come home, a man \u2014 \nAnd let me say \u2014 let me say something else. Let me say something else. No nominee for president should ever fail in the midst of a war to pay tribute to our troops overseas in his acceptance speech. Mitt Romney \u2014 Mitt Romney was talking about America.\nThey are on the front lines every day defending America, and they deserve our thanks. Some of us \u2014 some of us \u2014 some of us from a prior war remember coming home was not always easy. President Obama has made it his mission that we welcome our troops home with care and concern and the respect they deserve. That is how an exceptional nation says thank you to its most exceptional men and women. \nMitt Romney says he believes in America and that he will restore American exceptionalism. I have news for him: We already have an exceptional American as president, and we believe in Barack Obama. \nThank you, and God bless America. ", "Good evening. \nHalf a century ago, Ronald Reagan, the man whose optimism was inspiring to me to enter politics \u2014 he famously said at one time that he did not leave the Democratic Party, but the party left him. Well, listen, I can relate. Then again, my friend Jeb Bush recently noted, Reagan himself would have been too moderate, too reasonable for today's GOP.\nWe face serious challenges in our country. We must create good middle-class jobs so we can have an economy that is built to last. We must rebuild our roads and bridges and improve our public schools. And particularly important to me and my state of Florida is the challenge of saving Medicare and Social Security so we can keep our promise to our seniors. \nBut there are common-sense solutions within our reach, if we only have leaders who are willing and enthusiastic to find common ground.\nNo political party has the monopoly on that kind of leadership, but as a former lifelong Republican, it pains me to tell you that today's Republicans and their standard-bearers Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan just aren't up to the task. \nI'll be honest with you. I don't agree with President Obama about everything, but I've gotten to know him, and I've worked with him. And the choice is crystal clear. When he took office, the economic crisis had already put my state of Florida on the edge of disaster. The foreclosure crisis was consuming homeowners, the tourists we depend on couldn't visit and our vital construction industry had come to a standstill. President Obama saw what I saw \u2014 a catastrophe in the making \u2014 and he took action. \nOne of his first trips in office brought him to Fort Myers, Florida, where I was proud to embrace him and his plan to keep our teachers, police and firefighters on the job. Well, that hug caused me more grief from my party than you can ever imagine. But even as the Republican Party fought tooth and nail to stop him, this president showed his courage, invested in America and saved our Florida.\n\nTwo years later Florida and the Gulf Coast faced the worst environmental disaster in our nation's history, this time when a ruptured well spilled nearly 5 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. President Obama came to our rescue again, leading a massive cleanup effort and demanding accountability from those responsible. \nYou know, I used to play quarterback just down the road from here at Wake Forest University. And my dad always \u2014 \u2014 go Deacons! And my dad always told me, he said, Charlie, it takes a cool head to win a hot game. My friends, our country is in the middle of a hot game. And we face serious challenges both at home and abroad. Meanwhile, our politics are defined by discord and discontent. Never has it been harder for a president to keep a cool head, and never has it been more important.\nI look around Florida. I see a state bursting with diversity and opportunity, a state that looks like America's future. When I look at the Republican ticket today, I see two candidates who would break the fundamental promise of Medicare and Social Security and cut investments on our middle class that are so important to our recovery.\nAnd then I look at Barack Obama. I see a leader with a cool head, a caring heart and an open mind, a president who has demonstrated through his demeanor, his grace and his deeds that he is uniquely qualified to heal our divisions, rebuild our nation and lead us to a brighter future.\nThat's the leader Florida needs. That's the leader America needs. That's the reason I'm here tonight, not as a Republican, not as a Democrat, simply as an American who understands that we must come together behind the one man who can lead the way forward in these challenging times, my president, your president, Barack Obama. \nGod bless you, and God bless America. Thank you so much. ", "Settle down. Settle down.\nI know Mitt Romney. We were governors at the same time. Both elected straight from the business world. We traveled together to Iraq and Afghanistan. Spend a week in a war zone with a guy, and you really get to know him. \nWe traded stories about our early years: his as a missionary in France, and mine as a soil scientist in Libya and Saudi Arabia. \nWe talked about family, religion, business, energy, war and peace and the future of America.\nAnd I'll tell you this: Mitt's a good man, a good family man and a loyal American. \nBut \u2014 \nNow, Governor Mitt Romney saddled Massachusetts taxpayers with an additional 2.6 billion Now, remember those words. I might ask you to say them.\nGovernor Mitt Romney cut higher education by 14 percent in his first year, which meant that college education skyrocketed for students in Massachusetts. Now, I guess that's OK if you can afford it, but for the rest of us: That dog don't hunt.Now, Governor Mitt Romney raised taxes and fees by $750 million a year. Now, I'm going to let you in on a little secret. When a politician doesn't want to be honest about a tax hike, he calls it a fee. Now, Mitt raised taxes \u2014 I mean fees \u2014 on driver's licenses, on school bus rides, on mental health services and even on milk.\n\u2014 now, maybe just maybe that's OK for a guy who hunts varmints. But for the rest of us, that dog don't hunt.Now, Mitt, you can't just Etch A Sketch away your record. Taxes up, cost of college up, debt up \u2014 now, help me out here. New business starts down.Manufacturing down.Medium household income down.Economic growth down.You know, if private equity Mitt Romney met Governor Mitt Romney, he'd do what he says he likes to do. He'd fire him and outsource his job. \nNow \u2014 Clinton arithmetic.\nWe've had record budget surpluses every year I've been governor, averaging more than $400 million in surpluses, even during the Great Recession. We invested more new money in education than ever before, frozen tuition at our colleges for the longest period ever, and get this, we increased the percentage of adults with college degrees faster than any other state.\nAnd our bond rating was upgraded.\nNow, Montana is moving in the right direction, and so is America. \nWe are demanding more from our schools, but we're backing up that demand by investing more in teachers, increasing financial aid and doubling funding for Pell Grants. \nNow, while he was doing all of that, President Obama cut our taxes. He cut taxes 18 times for small businesses. He cut taxes by $3,600 for the typical middle-class family.\nNow, that dog does hunt.\nNow, Governor Romney, he said that finding Osama bin Laden was \u2014 and I'll quote him \u2014 \"not worth moving heaven and earth.\" \nWell, tonight, bin Laden isn't on earth. Sure isn't in heaven. \nAll four \u2014 all four of my grandparents were immigrants. They homesteaded the Montana prairie with nothing more than the clothes on their backs and faith in God, and the hope in their hearts that their kids and grandkids would have a better future. They delivered on that hope, and so has President Obama. Now it's our turn to deliver. Not just for the president's but for our kids, for our grandkids. This election is about their education, their health care, their freedom, their dignity, their hope and their future.\nAre we going to deliver?Are we going to keep America moving forward?Are we going to hire the right guy to finish the job for four more years?How many years?How many years?You got it. Let's get to work, America. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. ", "Hello, Charlotte! I've got to tell you, I have been on a lot of stages in my life, but none as important as this one.\nI am honored to be here as co-chair of President Obama's re- election campaign. I feel fortunate to be standing on this stage tonight, and I never could have imagined it growing up.\nI was born in Corpus Christi, Texas. \nYou see, for me, college was not an option; it was mandatory. So even though we didn't have a lot of money, we made it work. I signed up for financial aid, Pell Grants, work-study, anything I could. And just like our president and first lady, I took out loans to pay for school. I changed oil in a mechanic shop, I flipped burgers at Wendy's, I taught aerobics and I worked on campus to pay those loans back. And like a lot of you, I did whatever it took, and four years later, I got my degree. \nBut more importantly, I got a key to American opportunity, because that's who we are, a nation that rewards ambition with opportunity, where hard work can lead to success no matter where you start. As I travel the country for the president, I see Americans of every background fighting to succeed. They're optimistic, they're ambitious, they're hardworking, but they also want to know that their hard work will pay off.\nAnd we're lucky that our president understands the value of American opportunity, because he's lived it. And he's fighting to help others achieve it. He's fighting to make college more affordable. He's cut taxes for every working American.\nHe's helping small businesses get loans and has cut their taxes 18 times --\nMitt Romney would raise taxes on middle-class families to cut his own and mine. And that's not who we are as a nation. And let me tell you why: because the Eva Longoria who worked at Wendy's flipping burgers, she needed a tax break. But the Eva Longoria who works on movie sets does not. \nPresident Obama, he is fighting for changes that grow the economy from the middle out and help all Americans succeed: jobs, education, health reform, the DREAM Act \u2014 \u2014 equal pay for women. President Obama is moving us forward with opportunity today for prosperity tomorrow. Mitt Romney wants to take us back to yesterday.\nAnd that's not what's going to work because America was built by optimists, optimists like my friend Amanda who recently started a small business. And she went to buy her website address, her first and last name, and she found out somebody already owned it but wasn't using it. So my friend emailed the owner of the site, and she asked if she could buy it. Well, the owner wrote back. She's a 13-year-old girl who shares Amanda's name.\nAnd she politely explained that she could not give up the website. Why? Because the younger Amanda plans to be president of the United States one day \u2014 \nSo, here's a little girl, 13 years old, who believes that she can build her American dream, and here's a president who's building an America where that dream is possible. ", "Good evening. I'm Jennifer Granholm from the great state of Michigan \u2014 \u2014 where the trees are just the right height.\nAnd let me tell you a story about the dark days in my home state. So toward the end of my time as governor, Ford closed one of its biggest factories, a factory in Wixom, Michigan. And the plant had employed over the years thousands of middle-class men and women in neighborhoods near and worlds away from the place where Mitt Romney was raised.\nAnd when Ford's decision to close the factory hit, I went down to the local union hall, and it was actually almost empty. A few workers were milling about, really in a state of shock and grief. And I talked to a 45-year-old guy who told me, this is the only place I've ever worked. I've been loyal, I've done everything they've ever asked and just like that, it's gone. And he looked around the hall and he said, so, governor, is it over for us? Is the American auto industry dead? And honestly, at that moment, I just didn't know.\nBut that was just the beginning. When the financial crisis hit, things got worse and fast. The entire auto industry and the lives of over 1 million hardworking Americans teetered on the edge of collapse, and with it, the entire manufacturing sector of this country, and we looked everywhere for help.\nAlmost nobody had the guts to help us. Not the banks, not the private investors, and not Bain Capital. \nBut in 2009, the cavalry arrived, and our new president, Barack Obama, came in. \nNow you know, you know, Mitt Romney, he saw the same crisis. And you know what he said: Let Detroit go bankrupt. Now, sure, sure, Mitt Romney loves our lakes and our trees. \nYou know what I'm saying. You know what I'm saying. Mitt Romney, he says \u2014 he says that his business experience qualifies him to be president. Sure, he's a lot of money. Good for him. Good for him. Or maybe I should say, good for HIM.\nBut how did he make that fortune? And at whose expense?\nYou know too often he made it at the expense of middle- class Americans year after year. It was profit before people.\nBut President Obama, with the auto rescue \u2014 you know, he saved more than 1 million American jobs. USA! Because \u2014 all right now \u2014 because when Mitt Romney did say, let Detroit go bankrupt, who took the wheel? Barack Obama! When America was losing 750,000 jobs per month, who gave us a lift?\nBarack Obama.When American markets broke down, who jump-started our engine? Barack Obama.And when America needed it most, who got us rolling again on the road to recovery?America, we need to rev up our engines in your car and on your ballot. The \"D\" is for drive forward; the \"R\" is for reverse. ", "You all having a good time? \nThat's Barack and Michelle Obama's story. And like so many of you, that's my parents' story too. My father was a construction worker who dug the ditches and laid the pipe and concrete to build our highways. My mother arrived in this country as a newlywed with no money, no English and no family of her own.\nTogether, they realized the dream of sending their four children where no man or woman in our family in America had ever gone before: college. El sueno americano. The American dream. In any language, that's what this election is about. We need President Obama for four more years to keep that dream alive.\nWhen President Obama was elected, the American dream was on life support. The middle class was being hollowed out. We cannot afford to go back to the failed policies of the past. \nNow, maybe Governor Romney has forgotten how we got into the mess that President Obama faced, but we haven't \u2014 two wars, tax breaks for the wealthiest, the Wall Street bailout, Katrina. Nearly 9 million Americans lost their jobs because of the Great Recession. Our neighbors lost their homes, our teachers, firefighters and police officers were laid off and our small businesses couldn't get the bailed out banks to offer them any credit. How many construction workers like my father do you think could dream of reaching the middle class under those conditions?\nWe've all heard the saying put your money where your mouth is. Well, Governor Romney, ante up. Show us how your economic policies differ from President Bush's. If you believe in America, you invest in America. We don't need someone who will be a poster child for the Cayman Islands sitting in the Oval Office.\n\nSo I ask you: Is it courageous to cut funding for college loans or to vow to veto the dream for immigrant children?Is it responsible to reward companies that ship American jobs overseas with more tax loopholes?'Is it bold to say our country is broke and then hand out yet another deficit-busting tax break to millionaires and billionaires?And is it right to pull the rug out from under older Americans after a lifetime of hard work and turn Medicare into a voucher system, \"Couponcare\"?\"Couponcare.\" Really, Mr. Romney, \"Couponcare\"? If you want to save the middle class, you don't outsource it; you strengthen it. \nPresident Obama is fighting for the middle class. He's fighting to put Americans back to work and our country back on track. And President Obama believes in the promise of America. And President Obama believes in you. \nThe American dream, el sueno americano. Dr. King marched for it. Cesar Chavez organized for it. And this fall we will vote for it. Together, we're going to re-elect Barack Obama president of the United States.\nAdelante! ", "It's an honor to join you tonight for the most important reason I can imagine: to make sure that Barack Obama is re- elected president of the United States. \nFour years ago I was inspired by the way Senator Obama had lived his life, fighting for jobs, giving hope to the hopeless and working day in and day out for the America he believes in. I was inspired by Barack Obama's vision for America, an America where we look out for one another, where we take responsibility for our sisters and brothers, and most of all, for our children.\nBack then, I was inspired by the promise of Barack Obama's presidency. Today I'm inspired by his record. \nOver the past four years, we have had a president who has committed himself and his administration to the values that made America great: economic fairness, equal opportunity and the belief that if each of us gives back to this country we love, and all of us work together, there is no challenge we cannot overcome.\nThose are the ideals that my father and my uncles fought for. Those are the ideals I believe in. And this election is about whether we will advance those ideals or let them be swept away. Like my father's election in 1960, this is one of those elections where the future of our country is at stake.\nAnd \u2014 \nAs a Catholic woman, I take reproductive health seriously, and today it is under attack. This year alone, more than a dozen states have passed more than 40 restrictions on women's access to reproductive health care. That's not the kind of future I want for my daughters or your daughters. \nPresident Obama has shown the same commitment when it comes to our children. He has put our ideals into action for the next generation. He has inspired them to get involved, he has listened to their ideas and he has committed us all to building a better future for them.\nHe's challenged states to raise standards for teaching and learning, and almost all of them have. He has fought for early childhood education, putting outstanding teachers in every classroom and making college accessible to all young dreamers. \nI know Barack Obama will fight for women and children and all Americans because he has proven it. He has the quality my father most admired in public life: courage. \nBarack Obama is the kind of leader my father wrote about in \"Profiles in Courage.\" He doesn't just do what's easy. He does what's hard. He does what's right. \nMy father couldn't run for a second term. It was left to his brothers, our family and the generation they inspired to fight for the America he believed in. Now it's up to a new generation, our children's generation, to carry America forward.\nSo let me say to the young and the young at heart: Barack Obama is only president because you worked for him, because you believed in him, because you convinced your parents to vote for him. \nYoung people have always led America towards a brighter future. It happened in 1960; it happened in 2008. And if you show the same spirit in this election as you did in the last, I know that we'll make history again on November 6th.\nThank you. ", "Thank you. Thank you. It is an honor, an honor to be here tonight. I speak to you not as a representative of young Hollywood but as a representative of the many millions of young Americans, particularly young women, who depend on public and nonprofit programs to help them survive. \nI grew up in New York City. \nIn 2008, less than half of all eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 voted \u2014 less than half. Young America, why are we only speaking with half our voice when so many issues at stake here directly affect us? \nYou know who I am voting for. I'm not going to tell you who to vote for. I'm here to ask you to commit to vote. It's never been easier than now. You can go to commit.barackobama.com to register, find your polling location, any other information that you need. It's that easy.\nYou know, earlier this week Chelsea Clinton reminded us that we are the generation who feel our voices haven't been heard.\nSo vote so that your voice is heard. \nOver the last two days we've been reminded of something that perhaps we forgot: what has been accomplished and what is at stake, whether we can get health care, afford college, be guaranteed equal pay. All of these things are at great, great risk. And that's why I'm here today, to use whatever attention I'm fortunate enough to receive to shed the spotlight on what's at stake for all of us. \nYou know, when I was a little girl, my mother \u2014 she's a registered Democrat \u2014 Anyway, I remember that excitement I felt in that secret box. And I felt like my mom's vote wasn't just about the candidate; it was about our family and all the families in our community just like ours.\nThis last election, I finally got to punch those buttons for real, for me. \nSo get out there. Exercise your right to vote. Thank you. ", "Thank you. Thank you. Good evening, and hello, South Carolina. \nFifty-two years ago President Kennedy accepted our party's nomination, saying: \"We are not here to curse the darkness; we are here to light a candle.\" This is the fundamental difference between the party of Barack Obama and the party of Romney-Ryan. President Obama has lit candle after candle, bringing our country out from the darkness of recession, only to see Republicans douse the flames and amuse themselves cursing the darkness.\nThe Romney-Ryan Republicans, however, have walked away from bipartisan efforts to responsible approaches to move this country forward, bringing only more darkness. The architect of the Republicans' backwards blueprint is none other than vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan. The Romney-Ryan plan will cut taxes for the wealthiest 1 percent, end the guarantee of Medicare, and it will try to balance the budget on the backs of hardworking Americans.\nWhen too many of our senior citizens were living their golden years in the darkness of economic insecurity, Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt and the Democratic Congress created Social Security, lighting a candle, while the Republicans cursed the darkness.\nWhen too many of our elderly found their lives darkened by unaffordable and inaccessible health care, Lyndon Johnson and a Democratic Congress lit the candles of Medicare and Medicaid while Republicans stood on the sidelines and cursed the darkness.\nWhen the economy of our country languished in uncertainty, William Jefferson Clinton and a Democratic Congress lit the candles that illuminated the pathway to prosperity, reducing the deficit \u2014 And we did it with \u2014 that's right \u2014 every Republican in the Congress cursing the darkness.\nWhen President Obama was sworn into office, our economy was losing over 700,000 jobs per month. Affordable, quality care for all Americans was an unfulfilled, century-old pursuit. Bin Laden was plotting attacks while our troops were bogged down in Iraq. So President Obama went to work lighting candles. He promised to bring Osama bin Laden to justice \u2014 done. And he championed a Veterans Job Corps to put our returning veterans back to work.\nPresident Obama's actions saved jobs throughout the automobile industry. One point \nAnd President Obama's courage made affordable, accessible, quality health care a right, not a privilege. \nWe should not run from the term \"Obamacare.\" I am glad Obama cares. Because Obama cares, people with catastrophic illnesses can no longer be dropped from coverage when they get sick. Families will no longer have their benefits capped.\nThis preacher's kid is told by Romans 13, verse 12: The night is far spent, the day is at hand: Let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light.\nLet us go from this place, lighting candles all across this great country, and re-elect President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden so they can continue lighting candles and moving this country forward. ", "My dad is Joe Biden. A few years ago he wrote a memoir. For his title, he quoted the line from Robert Frost's famous poem. He called it \"Promises to Keep.\" In the last four years, you've seen my father partner with President Obama to keep the promises they made and the sacred promises we made: the promises we made to our elderly, who have had \u2014 who have a \u2014 earned a dignified retirement; the promises we make to our children, who deserve a chance to succeed; the promises we make that if you play by the rules and work hard, things will work out.\nOne of those promises is to a group of people close to my heart, my brothers and sisters in uniform. \nFour years ago \u2014 four years ago I told you that my father has always been there for me, for my sister, and as vice president, he would be there for you. And he has. I've seen it. \nI've watched him strengthen relationships with our allies and stare down our adversaries. I've seen him make quiet visits to veterans' hospitals and private phone calls to the families of first responders killed in the line of duty. I've seen him salute the workers in factories that are only open because of the decisions that he and the president had the courage to make. I've seen him shake the hand of every single high school student in a graduating class of 900 because he wants those kids to remember the day they got their diplomas and to do something big with them. \nFor me \u2014 for me, the most memorable moment of the past four years was not something most Americans saw. In fact, it wasn't even on American soil. It took place in Iraq, at Camp Victory, where I was stationed.\nIt was the 4th of July in 2009. My father was there on one of his many trips to the region, as part of his work, I might add, to bring that war to an end. \nI had the privilege \u2014 I had the privilege to watch him lead a naturalization ceremony in one of Saddam Hussein's palaces for a couple hundred men and women from all the branches of our military. As he led those new Americans through the oaths of citizenship, this celebration of democracy in a land of a deposed dictator, I was struck by the strength and diversity of our country. I was reminded why we as a nation are stronger when everybody has a chance to do their part. And I was reminded of everything President Obama and my father have done to guarantee that chance.\nWe do have promises to keep. And my dad and Barack Obama are keeping them. And yes \u2014 and yes, we have miles to go before we sleep. But Barack Obama and Joe Biden are leading the way forward.\nFour years ago, because I was going to Iraq, I asked you to be there for my dad, and you were. And for the last four years, I can say with certainty he has been there for us. In moments \u2014 in moments \u2014 in moments both public and private, he's the father I've always known, the grandfather my children love and adore and the vice president our nation needs.\nSo tonight, Mr. Chairman, it's my great honor to place into nomination for the office of vice president of the United States my father, my hero, Joe Biden. \nI move to suspend the rules and nominate by acclamation Joe Biden as the Democratic vice presidential candidate. ", "Good evening. I'm Kenyetta Jones from Toledo, Ohio. \nAfter I was laid off from General Motors' transmission assembly plant in 2009, I didn't sit around feeling sorry for myself. Instead I started training people with basic skills so when the jobs came back, they would be ready. Thanks to President Obama, these jobs did come back. \nThere are heroes all across America. Joining me on stage are some of those heroes who the president met on his road to Charlotte, people who display the quiet heroism we see so often in this country.\nEd Meagher is a Vietnam war veteran who for nine years has been placing a welcoming arm around the soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. He has helped them to readjust to civilian life, prepare for jobs and simply come home again.\nLucas Beenken is an Iraq war veteran so committed to his Iowa community that when he ran from \nRob Hach and his wife Tara are entrepreneurs who worked hard building their clean energy businesses in Alta, Iowa.\n\nMartha Figueroa is a third-grade teacher at Saint \nRyan Case overcame personal tragedy and committed himself to his future by going back to school, thanks to President Obama's support of Pell Grants. \nToday he is committed to expanding the opportunity for other young people by encouraging them to re-elect President Obama. \nThese are the people who make our communities stronger and make us all proud. Please join me in acknowledging these American heroes. ", "I'm so proud to represent the millions of volunteers who make up the vast grassroots organization in the history of American politics. Let's hear it for our neighborhood team leaders! We're going to talk to one right now.\nHey, New Mexico, can you hear me? \nAll right! Are you fired up? \nAll right. Every morning, the first thing I read are the numbers from the day before. Not poll numbers or money; the numbers that mean something: door knocks, conversations, registered voters. Our volunteers have made 44 million calls and knocked on 3.8 million doors.\nWe're doing exactly what the Republicans don't want us to do: getting more people involved in our democracy; giving more Americans a voice in their future. Here's how the greatest grassroots organization in the history of American campaigns is going to do just that:\nFirst, register to vote right now. Go to GottaRegister.com. That's G-O-T-T-A, register.com. Second, if you're already registered, go to commit.barackobama.com.\nWe need each and every one of you to commit to vote for Barack Obama today. Third, take out your phone. For the first time in political history, you can donate by texting. Just text \"give\" to 62262 to donate $10 right now. That's 62262.\nYou know, voting in Iowa starts in just three weeks from today. \nThis election isn't about Barack Obama or Mitt Romney. It's about you. The other guys write $10 million checks and make $10,000 bets. But we've made this campaign bet on you. I'd make that bet every day and twice on Tuesday, especially when that Tuesday is Election Day. Thank you. ", "Thank you, Charlotte. \nNow, people always want to know what it's like having lesbian parents, so let you in on a little secret: I'm awesome at putting the seat down. Otherwise, we're like any other family. We eat dinner, we go to church, we have chores.\nBut some people don't see it that way. When I was 12, watching the 2004 Republican Convention, I remember politicians talking about protecting marriage from families like mine. Now, supporting a view of marriage as between a man and woman isn't radical. For many people, it's a matter of faith. We respect that.\nWatching that convention on TV, though, I felt confused, frustrated. Why didn't they think my family was a real family? Governor Romney says he's against same-sex marriage because every child deserves a mother and a father. I think every child deserves a family as loving and committed as mine \u2014 \u2014 because the sense of family comes from the commitment we make to each other to work through the hard times so we can enjoy the good ones.\nIt comes from the love that binds us. That's what makes a family. \nMr. Romney, my family is just as real as yours. Without his leadership, we wouldn't be here.\nPresident Obama is fighting for our families, all our families. \nThank you, Charlotte, and thank you, President Obama. ", "I'm honored to serve as mayor of my hometown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. \nI'm most honored to be the father of Christian and Olivia and a proud parent of a current high school student. My wife, Lisa, and I know that Olivia's education is central to everything that she and everyone in our city wants to achieve. In Philadelphia our public education, poverty reduction, health and economic development all start with education. We can't grow the middle class if we don't give our kids the tools they need to innovate and invent.\nBut first we have to invest in them. That's what President Barack Obama did, saving 400,000 educators' jobs and giving states the flexibility to shape their schools. Mitt Romney doesn't get it. He recently visited a school in West Philly and told teachers that he knows more than they do about what works for their students. He said class size doesn't matter. \nDoesn't matter? If our teachers can't give our children the attention they need, that doesn't matter? If our students spend the day on their feet or the floor because there aren't enough desks in a crowded classroom, that doesn't matter? Well, let me tell you who it does matter to. It matters to Olivia. It matters to her classmates. It matters to all of our public school students in Philadelphia. And that's what matters. \nTo Mitt Romney, education is a luxury. As governor, he vetoed universal pre-K. In his first year, K-12 schools saw dramatic cuts that led to teacher layoffs. He failed his students.\nWhat has he learned from all this? All the wrong lessons. He failed the education test and now wants a promotion. His budget would mean fewer teachers and bigger class sizes. It would mean fewer Pell Grants, costing our country millions of college graduates. And he wants to put big banks back in the student loan business. And just ask him about affording college, like one high schooler did in Ohio. Romney's answer? Shop around.\nWell, here are some wiser words from a great Philadelphian, Ben Franklin. He said: An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.\nSounds like Mitt Romney could stand to learn a thing or two about investing. Our economy grows from the middle out, not the top down. We're all in this together.\nI learned that lesson growing up in West Philly. When I shoveled the sidewalk, my parents didn't let me stop with our house. They told me to keep shoveling all the way to the corner. I had a responsibility to my community, and that's what being mayor is all about. We take care of our own. We keep our neighbors safe, clear the snow from their streets, educate their kids. We get stuff done.\nAnd for Barack Obama, that's what being president is all about. He knows coming together as a nation starts by coming together as neighbors. That's why, after graduating, Barack Obama went to a Chicago neighborhood to help jobless workers in the shadow of a closed down steel mill.\nAfter Mitt Romney graduated, he became a corporate buyout specialist who closed down steel mills.\nWhose values do you want in the Oval Office? Well, I know who I want, and I know who Philly wants, and I know who Pennsylvania wants, and I know who you want, and I know who the middle class needs: President Barack Obama! ", "On behalf of the great state of Wisconsin and our proud progressive tradition, thank you. I know you've heard a lot about Wisconsin lately. You've heard about Paul Ryan, who wants to end Medicare as we know it. You've heard about Scott Walker \u2014 \u2014 who took basic rights away from teachers, nurses and public employees. Maybe you've even heard about Tommy Thompson, our former governor who went to Washington, cashed in on his special interest connections and never really came back.\nWell, I'm here to tell you that they don't speak for all of Wisconsin. And I want you to hear about the Wisconsin I know, the place where my grandparents raised me, the place where generations of families have worked hard to get ahead, the place where our state motto might sound familiar to you.\nIt's just one word: \"Forward.\" \nWe believe that if we're going to prosper, everyone has to have a fair shot, and everyone has to do their fair share. That's why I'm proud to lead the charge for the Buffett rule, which makes sure that millionaires and billionaires don't get to pay a lower tax rate than hardworking middle-class families. And President Obama is standing with me. But Mitt Romney wants to pass even more tax cuts for those at the very top. The Wisconsin I know knows that their plan will only bust our budget, not boost our economy. We believe in a level playing field.\nMore than a decade ago the big Wall Street banks came to Congress and asked us to repeal an important law called Glass-Steagall, allowing them to gamble like hedge funds. Too many in Washington said yes. Russ Feingold and I said no. And after \u2014 President Obama fought for that reform. Mitt Romney wants to repeal it. But the Wisconsin I know knows that having two sets of rules makes no kind of sense.\nIn Wisconsin, we believe in hard work. Give our workers a fair shot, and we'll compete against anyone. And that's why I'm taking on China's cheating and betting on Wisconsin workers.\nPresident Obama believes in our manufacturers. That's why he's standing with me to support companies creating jobs here, and not shipping them overseas.\nMitt Romney wants to give up on our manufacturing sector. But the Wisconsin I know knows that an economy built to last says \"Made in America\" on the label. \nAnd we believe that American history moves in one direction \u2014 forward. \u2014 so that no American ever again has to lie about who they are in order to serve the country we love.\nRepublicans want to write discrimination into our Constitution. But the Wisconsin I know believes that with each passing year and each generation, our country must become more equal, not less. \nMitt Romney, Paul Ryan, Scott Walker, Tommy Thompson \u2014 they think they're the only ones who speak for Wisconsin. ", "Good evening. To the California delegation, I see you \u2014 \u2014 and I love you.\nTo my children, who've been here all week, my family, I love you most of all.\nTo the folks from North Carolina and Charlotte \u2014 \nYou know, I'm proud to be the mayor of the great city of Los Angeles, the city of America's hope and promise and the entertainment capital of the world. But I have to say, when it comes to entertainment, to great stories and tall tales, the Republican Convention gave Hollywood a run for their money. \nYou know, it's been the privilege of a lifetime to hold the gavel at this historic convention, where tonight Barack Obama will accept our party's nomination for a second term as president of the United States. \nLook around you, everyone. This has been the most diverse, most inclusive convention ever held anywhere in the United States of America \u2014 \nAnd this is a reflection of who we are as a party and who we can be as a nation. Because as Democrats, as Americans, whenever we've opened up our party and our country, whenever we've opened up our doors for more of our people, whenever we've deepened our democracy and renewed our commitment to equal justice under the law, we've grown stronger as a nation. \nLast week in Tampa, we were promised hard truths. And they were right about one thing. The truth was hard to find. That's why they didn't talk about their plan to cut taxes for millionaires by raising taxes on middle-class families with kids \u2014 on your family \u2014 by $2,000.\nThey didn't talk about their plan to replace the guarantee of Medicare with a coupon, with a voucher that might not cover the cost of care and could force seniors to pay up to $6,400 more a year.\nThey didn't talk about their plan to deny a woman control over the basic decisions that affect her health.\nNo. The Romney campaign bragged that it wouldn't be dictated by fact-checkers. What they meant is, their campaign wouldn't be dictated by facts. \nThey said they have a plan, but they didn't share it because they know it's not a plan that the American people want. Americans don't want to go backwards; they want to go forward.\n\nWe know that some of our Republican friends may not have agreed with everything they've heard here in Charlotte. But at least they heard the facts. They heard solutions. They heard an honest description of the choice we face. And tonight they'll hear from a president who's fighting for all of us. \nIn his first term, he fought for the student who's trying to pay for college. He fought for the small-business owner striving for a piece of the American dream. He fought for the men and women in uniform who are fighting for us. \nAnd he fought for the \"DREAMers\" \u2014 \u2014 young people brought here as children through no fault of their own. And instead of supporting their dream, Governor Romney wants to make life so miserable, so oppressive, so intolerable for them that they would leave the life they built behind, leave their children behind and self-deport.\nHow about that for family values? \nBut you know, we believe we're a better country than that. And thanks to President Obama, as we keep on fighting for the DREAM Act, they can remain in the country they love. \nYou know, in LA we know that communities are stronger for their diversity, from Westwood to Wilmington, from Silver Lake to Sherman Oaks. We may come from different backgrounds. We may speak different languages. We may even worship in different ways. But all of us, no matter our accent or our ancestry, are pursuing the same American dream.\nIt's the dream that brought my grandfather here from Leon, Guanajuato, Mexico, to Los Angeles a century ago with no money, even less English, but an unshakable faith in the relationship between work and reward. It's the dream that allowed his grandson, the son of a single mom, a child of Boyle Heights, to graduate from UCLA.\nAnd you know, some people \u2014 I got there on an affirmative action program, and some people would say I came in through the backdoor. But one thing's for sure: I got out the front. \nYou know, I know how I got here. I worked hard. And I grew up in an America where hard work paid off.\nThat's the promise of this great country. And this week we came to Charlotte to restore that promise.\nAnd while this convention ends tonight, our work is not done. In the days and weeks ahead, we're going to register more voters, knock on more doors, get out more votes for this party and this president. \nGod bless you. Thank you, and God bless America. ", "Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm \u2014 thank you. I was so honored when President Obama asked me to serve as chair of the Democratic Party. Thank you. Thank you.\nBut there's one job I'm even more proud of, and that's being a mom to my three kids, Rebecca, Jake and Shelby. \nWhen I addressed our convention that year, I spoke about what the stakes were for our country. What I didn't tell you was how high the stakes were for my family. In 2007 I was diagnosed with breast cancer. In 2008, right before the convention, I had one of seven surgeries I'd have that year.\nI was fortunate, though. I had good insurance and great doctors. And today I stand before you as a survivor. \nBut like every breast cancer survivor, I now have a pre-existing condition. I know what it's like to sit in that waiting room wondering how many more anniversaries you'll get with your husband, how many more birthdays you'll celebrate with your kids. I don't care how strong a woman you are; that moment is terrifying. And in America, no one should have to go through it without health insurance. No family should go broke just because a mom gets sick.\nSo when President Obama passed health care reform, it was personal. And when Governor Romney says he would repeal \"Obamacare\" and put insurance companies back in charge of a woman's health, that's personal too. \nThis election is personal for every American \u2014 \u2014 for the senior citizens that I meet across South Florida from Century Village to Sunrise Lakes to Aventura.\nNow, one woman told me, Debbie, thanks to the new law, I don't have to cut my pills in half each month. That's because President Obama is closing the prescription drug doughnut hole. \nAnd what Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan won't admit is that their plan would require current seniors to pay on average $600 more each year for prescription drugs. Unacceptable. And the Romney-Ryan plan would replace the guarantee of Medicare with a voucher that wouldn't even keep up with costs.\nNow, Congressman Ryan said that he wants Medicare to be around for his grandkids. Well, if that's the case, he had better vote for Barack Obama. \nI am \u2014 I am a proud Democrat. \nThese are President Obama's priorities. They are our priorities. This fall we will fight for them harder than ever. \nBut my friends, I can't keep that promise on my own. I need you to help me keep it. So when you feel too drained to register one more voter, when you feel too tired to make one more phone call or too exhausted to knock on one more door, I want you to dig just a little bit deeper. I want you to work just a little bit harder and make sure you don't get weary. Remember this is personal.\nLet's finish what we started and re-elect President Barack Obama! On to victory on November 6th! \nThank you so much. ", "Thank you. I'm not a delegate, and I'm not a politician. I'm a veteran. I was an Army Ranger captain \u2014 I now live with my wife and son in the great state of Colorado. But many of the men and women with whom I served never returned home. And others came home bearing visible and invisible scars of battle. When they and their families needed help, our commander in chief was there for them.\nFrom expanding veterans' benefits to strengthening the VA health system, President Obama knows that the miltiary is the standard bearer for American values. And it was wrong that men and women that I served with could be told that they weren't good enough just because of their sexual orientation. Soldiers that I trusted with my life and fought alongside with could be discharged simply because of who they loved. President Obama did the right thing by ending \"don't ask, don't tell.\"\n\nThe choice is clear.\nIn the biggest speech of his life, Governor Romney didn't mention our troops in Afghanistan even once. All our service members and veterans deserve four more years of a president who has their back. And that is why, right now, I am asking you to join me in supporting our president, our commander in chief, Barack Obama.\nThank you. ", "Buenas noches, democratas. \u2014 and on my way to law school at Boston College.\n\nFour years ago, on campuses all across this country, young people rose up to change the course of American history. In record numbers, we came together and finally elected a president who understands our struggles, shares our dreams and believes in our future. Some people say young people aren't excited about this election \u2014 \nBecause of the president's Affordable Care Act, 3.1 million young Americans who were previously uninsured can stay on their parents' health insurance. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan want to repeal health reform and take that coverage away. President Obama doubled funding for Pell Grants. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan would cut scholarships that are so critical to creating opportunities for those that need them most.\nThis president, on so many issues \u2014 immigration, LGBT rights \u2014 \u2014 it seems to me that Mitt Romney only cares about an elite few.\nMitt Romney recently called my generation a lost generation. He's wrong. We know exactly where we're going: forward, not backward. \nWe're going to register voters, knock on doors, turn out the vote, and on November 6th, re-elect our true champion, President Barack Obama. ", "Hello, Georgia. Hello, America.\nI first came to this city in 1961, the year Barack Obama was born. I was one of the 13 original Freedom Riders. We were on a bus ride from Washington to New Orleans trying to test a recent Supreme Court ruling that banned racial discrimination on buses across the state line.\nWe tested the waiting rooms, restroom facilities, but here in Charlotte, North Carolina, a young African-American tried to get a shoe shine at the Greyhound bus station. He was arrested and taken to jail.\nOn that same day we traveled to Rock Hill, South Carolina, about 25 miles from here. When my seatmate Albert Bigelow and I tried to enter a white waiting room, we were met by an angry mob that beat us and left us lying in a pool of blood. Some police officers came up and asked us whether we wanted to press charges. We said no, we come in peace, love and nonviolence. We said our struggle was not against individuals, but against unjust laws and customs. Our goal was a true freedom for every American.\nSince then, America has made a lot of progress. We are a different society than we were in 1961. And in 2008 we showed the world the true promise of America when we elected President Barack Obama. \nA few years ago a man from Rock Hill inspired by President Obama's election decided to come forward. He came to my office in Washington and said, I am one of the people who beat you. I want to apologize. Will you forgive me?\nI said, I accept your apology. He started crying. \nBrothers and sisters, do you want to go back?Or do you want to keep America moving forward? My dear friends, your vote is precious, almost sacred. It is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have to create a more perfect union.\nNot too long ago people stood in lines. They had to pass a so-called literacy test, pay a poll tax. On one occasion, a man was asked to count the number of bubbles in a bar of soap. On another occasion, one was asked to count the jelly beans in a jar, all to keep them from casting their ballot.\nToday it is unbelievable that there are Republican officials are trying to stop some people from voting. They are changing \u2014 they are changing the rules, cutting polling hours and imposing requirement intended to suppress the vote.\nThe Republican leader in the Pennsylvania House even bragged that his state's new voter ID law is going to allow Governor Romney to win the state. That's not right, that's not fair and that is not just. And similar efforts have been made in Texas, Ohio, Florida, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia and South Carolina.\nI've seen this before. I lived this before. Too many people struggled, suffered and died to make that possible for every American to exercise their right to vote. \nAnd we have come too far together to ever turn back. So, Democrats, we must not be silent. We must stand up, speak up and speak out. ", "How are you? Hello.\nNice of them to leave a gavel out for me to make me feel nostalgic. \nI have the problem we all have when we speak here. There are a lot of issues to talk about. So the question is, which ones do you pick? There are a number that interest me, like why it is that so many Republicans are afraid that my marriage will threaten theirs. \nOr why Mitt Romney thinks it's a bad thing that the president ended the war in Iraq.\nBut let's stick to the central themes of the economy.\nWe need to do more to get the economy back. Now, we inherited from the Republicans the worst economy in 80 years. And we are \u2014 been improving it over their objection and over their obstruction. But we'd like to move quicker.\nWell, one argument we get is that the Republican nominee, Mr. Romney, because of his private business experience, is a superior job creator and that if we elect him president, he will use those great private-sector skills as the chief executive to bring many more jobs. We've had an experiment in that. He was governor of the state I lived in, in Massachusetts. So if, in fact, Mitt Romney's private-sector experience makes him the superhero of job creation, we would have seen that in Massachusetts.\nIn fact, the record is that during his term, our job growth was only about 1.4 percent, which was a quarter of the national average. We were, under Mitt Romney, 47th in job growth. In fact, I represented an area of Massachusetts, proudly, places \u2014 New Bedford and Fall River \u2014 that have been hurt by national, international economic trends. And we wanted help to get commuter rail to the source of the jobs in the northern part of our state. We wanted to get a wind energy node projected. We wanted all these things. Under Mitt Romney we got no help. Under Mitt Romney we got no jobs.\nNow, I was puzzled. And I hear about this, and I wonder: How come, as I now hear about the great ability of this wizard of private- sector financial engineering to create jobs, that we didn't get any? And I realized, here is the problem. And this is a hard one for me because of my diction, so please listen carefully. It turns out our governor was Mitt Romney. What we should have had as governor was \"Myth\" Romney.\n\nNow, maybe as a Democrat I should be grateful that we got Mitt and not \"Myth\" because if \"Myth\" Romney had ever been governor and done all the things we're told we could do, he would have been re- elected overwhelmingly. Now, that might not have been good for the Democrats, but not following the Mitch McConnell view that your party's advantage is less important \u2014 is more important that the economic well-being of your constituents, I would have taken that.\nBut we didn't have \"Myth\" Romney. We had Mitt Romney, and he did the Democrats a favor, not the state. After four consecutive Republican elections when Mitt Romney ran for re-election \u2014 when his term was up he was afraid to run for re-election. He gallantly let his lieutenant governor take the fall and the Republicans haven't won any major elections in statewide office since \u2014 \u2014 for state office.\nWell, if we didn't get that job experience and we can't look to the past to be reassured, let's look to the future. What will any Romney \u2014 and you know, there're a lot of Romneys. There's the Romney who was going to be better on gay rights than Ted Kennedy. Now there's the Romney who checks with Rick Santroum on that issue. There was the Romney who was for climate change and now there's the Romney who believes that it's a myth, to coin a phrase.\nBut what \u2014 let's look at what we have from the Mitt Romney who's running for president. He has now basically committed himself to repeat every failed and mistaken policy that the Republican Party employed to bring our country into the greatest recession in years, and which they have followed to try to retard its recovery.\nAnd there's a reason for it. For all of the talk about how Mitt Romney understands the private sector \u2014 and that clearly is a little bit iffy \u2014 he has no understanding whatsoever of the public sector.\nOf course we want a private sector that is prosperous, that creates jobs. This hall is full of people I know who have been successful in the private sector, and do that, and are entrepreneurs and businesspeople. \nBut sensible people also know with a civilized society, you need a public sector to do those things that the private sector isn't meant to do, to deal with the quality of life. There are things that a civilized society needs that we can only do if we do them together. And we do them together, that's called government. So that's why Mitt \u2014 \u2014 that's why Mitt Romney opposed, opposed the successful effort to keep the automobile industry going, because he failed to see the importance of a private sector-public sector cooperation. That's why he belittled President Obama's concern for fired and laid-off public employees and the services they provide, when he said, oh, he just wants more teachers and firefighters and cops. Because we have had millions of private sector jobs created, but our unemployment has been higher than it should be, in part because hundreds and hundreds of thousands of hard-working public employees have been let go by Republican policies.\nAnd then finally \u2014 \u2014 finally, there is the sector on which I've worked hardest, the financial sector. The single biggest cause of our economic collapse was the failure of the Republican right wing \u2014 unfortunately, some Democrats joined in \u2014 to allow the public sector appropriately to regulate the private sector.\nI want a strong financial community. But I don't want subprime loans being given to people who can't pay them back. I don't want derivatives being engaged in by companies that can't back up when they get in trouble like AIG. I want an independent consumer engine that will protect the individual saver and borrower from abuse. I don't want municipalities to be advised by unscrupulous people who get them into trouble and they lose money.\nWe began in 2009 to put in place a set of rules to prevent the kind of abuse that led to the economic disaster. \"Myth\" Romney \u2014 and for all I know, Mitt Romney \u2014 opposes all of that. He has called for the repeal of financial reform, for allowing an unregulated financial community to go back to where they were. Every mistake the Republicans made to bring us into trouble, to resist our getting out of trouble and to keep us from getting into trouble again, Mitt Romney supports.\nAnd he reminds of an important historical statement. When the kings of France came back into power after the French Revolution, brought back by the excesses of that revolution, they began to make all the same mistakes they'd made before. And someone said, they appear to have forgotten everything. And someone said, no, they couldn't forget anything, because they never learned anything.\nThe current right-wing, tea party-dominated Republican not only hasn't learned from the mistakes of the past; they are determined to repeat them. We will not let that happen. Thank you. ", "Good evening, fellow Democrats.Since we were together in 2008, we have lost some of our leaders and our friends. First, one of Charlotte's own, Susan Burgess. She fought for what she believed in, and she fought her own battle with cancer.\nSadly, she did not get the chance to see this convention convene. But I know she'd be very proud, and she is tonight with us in spirit. \nThis brief film will highlight many other leaders who have passed in the last four years. Their work and their ideals inspire us every day. Tonight we salute their contributions.", "Hello, Maryland. \nNow, I come from a military family \u2014 six kids. My dad served three decades in the Air Force. My mom was right behind him and us. So the president and first lady's commitment to our service people, to our veterans and their families, it's personal to me. Let me tell you about my American story.\nGrowing up on military bases I learned like most families that they were just like mine, no matter what their background.\nI went to a lot of different schools and many different places. I had great teachers who loved learning and great parents who made me do my homework.\nI'm a first-generation graduate of Wake Forest University. \nNow look. After graduating college, I struggled, I struggled as a single mom. I had a toddler. I was working every day just to pay the bills. But I didn't have health insurance. And then days after days with what I thought was a cold, I ended up in an emergency room with pneumonia. The hospital bills were overwhelming. And as a result, I almost lost my home to foreclosure. On many days I found myself at a local food bank.\nI'll tell you, I support President Barack Obama because he gets it. He knows that no one, no one should end up in an emergency room facing financial ruin and the loss of middle-class life, my middle- class life, just because they can't afford a doctor's visit and a $20 batch of antibiotics.\nAnd so President Obama changed that. We know he changed that. He changed that with the Affordable Care Act. \nSo here's the bottom line. We've got a lot of challenges ahead of us \u2014 tremendous challenges ahead of us. But President Obama is solving them in a way that protects and helps families like mine. And that's why I'm fighting for him, just like he's been fighting for us. Are you ready to fight for him? ", "I am so proud to be at the Democratic National Convention from Florida. \nI'm one of the seniors who retired to this piece of heaven on earth, and I'm as happy as a clam. But it's not just the sunshine; it's \"Obamacare.\" I'm getting preventive care for free and my prescription drugs for less.\nBut the Romney-Ryan plan has me terrified, not just for me but for my three married daughters, who are in their 50s. If Mitt Romney gets into office, the Medicare that they've earned will return into \"Vouchercare.\" Seniors will get a voucher to purchase health insurance, but the vouchers won't keep up with the cost, which could push people into private insurance plans, and even though many seniors who are on fixed incomes would have to pay up to an additional $6,400 more a year for out-of-pocket costs. And on top of that, he's threatened to repeal \"Obamacare\" on day one.\nThousands of dollars might be pocket change to Mitt Romney, but it's a lot of money in my family. \nWe have worked for our Medicare, we have paid for our Medicare and we have earned our Medicare. \nI'm proud to have been born the same year that Social Security was. It was the most important law of my lifetime. And Medicare was pretty great, too. But now we have \"Obamacare,\" which preserves the promise of Medicare and a secure retirement. So like I tell my daughters, let's vote like our lives depend on it, because they do. ", "Let me start by welcoming you to Charlotte and to North Carolina. \nIt's been my honor to serve with Mayor Anthony Foxx as co-chair of the Charlotte Host Committee. I want to thank all of the people and local businesses who have worked tirelessly to make this a wonderful convention so far. And we haven't even got to the main event.\nNow, I'm not here tonight as a Democrat or a Republican, a policy pundit or an energy CEO. I'm here simply as a grandfather. I have eight grandkids, and my oldest grandson, Alex, is here with me today. Many of you have children and grandchildren. And we want to do all we can for their happiness, their health and for their future. We want to pass what I call the grandchildren's test.\nThat is, decades from now when our grandchildren look back at the decisions we made as a country, will they think that we did the right thing? We want their answer to be yes. \nOne way we can make this world a better place for our grandkids is to lay the groundwork for a cleaner, more sustainable future. Among other things, that means taking a long-term approach toward energy policy because these decisions should not be made in four-year election cycles. That's why an all-of-the-above energy strategy is a good place to start.\nBut we must be more innovative. We need to work even harder toward a future of affordable, reliable and even cleaner energy. That means we need to invest heavily in new zero-emissions power sources like new nuclear, wind and solar projects as well as new technologies like electric vehicles. And we cannot lose sight of energy efficiency, because the cleanest, most efficient power plant is the one we never have to build. \nHere in Charlotte, we're committed to energy efficiency and a more sustainable future. One of our first steps is to reduce our energy use by 20 percent in Charlotte's central business district.\nAnd we're thinking beyond energy. We're also increasing water conservation, reducing waste and improving our air. This is all part of a model that can be reproduced in cities across the country and even around the world because energy is more than a partisan issue, it's an American issue and a global issue.\nI know that we, the American people, have the ability to lead the world, to meet today's energy challenges, to cross the bridge to a cleaner, more secure world and, most importantly, to leave our grandchildren with a place where they can thrive. Thank y'all very much. Thank you for coming to Charlotte. ", "It is my honor to welcome everyone to North Carolina. North Carolina is strong because our people are strong. They define our state by their hard work, commitment to their families and neighbors, their willingness to sacrifice so that their children can have a chance to forge their own path.\nI've seen those values in every corner of our state \u2014 from our small towns to our big cities, from the beaches to the mountains, from our farms and mills to clean energy and advanced biotech companies. We call North Carolina the place where the weak grow strong and the strong grow great. We've always prided ourselves on the fact that anyone, no matter who they are or where they are from, can work hard to make whatever they want of their life.\nBut we didn't get there by accident. We got there because we were blessed with leaders from all walks of life who were willing to do what was right, make difficult not easy choices and invest in our future generations. We got there because a group of civic leaders had the vision to look over thousands of acres of empty land and see the potential for the Research Triangle Park, which today is a hub of innovation and job creation that employs thousands of people.\nWe got there because four young men were brave enough to sit down at a lunch counter in Greensboro in 1960. A lunch counter where they were not welcome simply because of the color of their skin. We got there because those young men sparked a movement that demanded equal opportunity for every one of our state's citizens.\nWe got there because in 1795, North Carolina opened the first public university in the United States, which grew into the best public university system in the country \u2014 \u2014 educating a workforce that fuels our economy.\nOur country needs that same forward-looking leadership now more than ever. The solutions of yesterday won't get us where we need to go. We can't get there by slashing education or cutting back on research and development. That's what the other side wants to do, but they've tried every one of their proposals before, and they've left us with a shrinking middle class and the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression.\nPresident Obama has a different plan. And you can find the whole thing online at barackobama.com/plan. And when you go there, you'll see a plan to keep building an economy that grows from the middle out, not the top down. That's what we need. That's how we'll keep moving forward together.\nThe eyes of the nation are on North Carolina tonight. And that's fitting because the same values that made North Carolina great \u2014 hard work, community, commitment to a vibrant middle class \u2014 are the values that are going to keep our country on the right track for generations to come.\nAnd I know that the energy that we see here tonight is going to carry us on through November and carry us to a better and brighter future.\nGod bless North Carolina, and God bless the United States.

Today, Barack Obama is carrying those exact same values forward as president of the United States. \nThis election is about standing up for those values. It's about fighting for what you believe in.

Thank you.\nNow, Mr. Mayor, fellow Democrats, we are here to nominate a president. \nI want to nominate a man whose own life has known its fair share of adversity and uncertainty. I want to nominate a man who ran for president to change the course of an already weak economy and then just six weeks before his election, saw it suffer the biggest collapse since the Great Depression; a man who stopped the slide into depression and put us on the long road to recovery, knowing all the while that no matter how many jobs that he saved or created, there'd still be millions more waiting, worried about feeding their own kids, trying to keep their hopes alive.\nI want to nominate a man who's cool on the outside \u2014 \nI want \u2014 I want a man who believes with no doubt that we can build a new American Dream economy, driven by innovation and creativity, but education and \u2014 yes \u2014 by cooperation. \nAnd by the way, after last night, I want a man who had the good sense to marry Michelle Obama. \nYou know \u2014 .\nI want \u2014 I want Barack Obama to be the next president of the United States. And I proudly nominate him to be the standard-bearer of the Democratic Party.\nNow, folks, in Tampa a few days ago, we heard a lot of talk \u2014 \u2014 all about how the president and the Democrats don't really believe in free enterprise and individual initiative, how we want everybody to be dependent on the government, how bad we are for the economy.\nThis Republican narrative \u2014 this alternative universe \u2014 \nWe Democrats \u2014 we think the country works better with a strong middle class, with real opportunities for poor folks to work their way into it \u2014 It is.\nSo who's right? Well, since 1961, for 52 years now, the Republicans have held the White House 28 years, the Democrats, 24. In those 52 years, our private economy has produced 66 million private sector jobs.\nSo what's the job score? Republicans, 24 million; Democrats, 42 \nNow, there's \u2014 \nNow, there's something I've noticed lately. You probably have too. And it's this. Maybe just because I grew up in a different time, but though I often disagree with Republicans, I actually never learned to hate them the way the far right that now controls their party seems to hate our president and a lot of other Democrats. I \u2014 President Eisenhower built the interstate highway system.\nWhen I was a governor, I worked with President Reagan and his White House on the first round of welfare reform and with President George H.W. Bush on national education goals.\n\nAnd I have been honored to work with both Presidents Bush on natural disasters in the aftermath of the South Asian tsunami, Hurricane Katrina, the horrible earthquake in Haiti. Through my foundation, both in America and around the world, I'm working all the time with Democrats, Republicans and independents. Sometimes I couldn't tell you for the life who I'm working with because we focus on solving problems and seizing opportunities and not fighting all the time. \nAnd so here's what I want to say to you, and here's what I want the people at home to think about. When times are tough and people are frustrated and angry and hurting and uncertain, the politics of constant conflict may be good. But what is good politics does not necessarily work in the real world. What works in the real world is cooperation. What works in the real world is cooperation, business and government, foundations and universities.\nAsk the mayors who are here. They didn't check their brains at the door. They didn't stop disagreeing, but their purpose was to get something done.\nNow, why is this true? Why does cooperation work better than constant conflict?\nBecause nobody's right all the time, and a broken clock is right twice a day. \nAnd every one of us \u2014 every one of us and every one of them, we're compelled to spend our fleeting lives between those two extremes, knowing we're never going to be right all the time and hoping we're right more than twice a day. \nUnfortunately, the faction that now dominates the Republican Party doesn't see it that way. They think government is always the enemy, they're always right, and compromise is weakness. \nThey beat a Republican congressman with almost a hundred percent voting record on every conservative score, because he said he realized he did not have to hate the president to disagree with him. Boy, that was a nonstarter, and they threw him out. \nOne of the main reasons we ought to re-elect President Obama is that he is still committed to constructive cooperation. \nAnd Joe Biden \u2014 Joe Biden did a great job with both. \nHe \u2014 \nWait a minute. I am \u2014 \nNow \u2014 \u2014 and for supporting our veterans when they came home, when they came home bearing the wounds of war or needing help to find education or jobs or housing.\nPresident Obama's whole record on national security is a tribute to his strength, to his judgment and to his preference for inclusion and partnership over partisanship. We need more if it in Washington, D.C. \nNow, we all know that he also tried to work with congressional Republicans on health care, debt reduction and new jobs. And that didn't work out so well. \nNow, are you ready for that? Are you willing to work for it. Oh, wait a minute.In Tampa \u2014In Tampa \u2014 in Tampa \u2014 did y'all watch their convention?\nI did. \nNow \u2014 \nAnd this is important, they convinced me they were honorable people who believed what they said and they're going to keep every commitment they've made. We just got to make sure the American people know what those commitments are \u2014 \u2014 because in order to look like an acceptable, reasonable, moderate alternative to President Obama, they just didn't say very much about the ideas they've offered over the last two years.\nThey couldn't because they want to the same old policies that got us in trouble in the first place. They want to cut taxes for high- income Americans, even more than President Bush did. They want to get rid of those pesky financial regulations designed to prevent another crash and prohibit future bailouts. They want to actually increase defense spending over a decade $2 trillion more than the Pentagon has requested without saying what they'll spend it on. And they want to make enormous cuts in the rest of the budget, especially programs that help the middle class and poor children.\nAs another president once said, there they go again.\n\nNow, I like \u2014 I like \u2014 I like the argument for President Obama's re-election a lot better. Here it is. He inherited a deeply damaged economy. He put a floor under the crash. He began the long, hard road to recovery and laid the foundation for a modern, more well- balanced economy that will produce millions of good new jobs, vibrant new businesses and lots of new wealth for innovators. \nNow, are we where we want to be today? No.Is the president satisfied? Of course not.But are we better off than we were when he took office? \nAnd listen to this. Listen to this. Everybody \u2014 \u2014 when President Barack Obama took office, the economy was in free fall. It had just shrunk 9 full percent of GDP. We were losing 750,000 jobs a month.\nAre we doing better than that today?The answer is yes.\nNow, look. Here's the challenge he faces and the challenge all of you who support him face. I get it. I know it. I've been there. A lot of Americans are still angry and frustrated about this economy. If you look at the numbers, you know employment is growing, banks are beginning to lend again. And in a lot of places, housing prices are even beginning to pick up.\nBut too many people do not feel it yet.\nI had the same thing happen in 1994 and early '95. We could see that the policies were working, that the economy was growing. But most people didn't feel it yet. Thankfully, by 1996 the economy was roaring, everybody felt it, and we were halfway through the longest peacetime expansion in the history of the United States. But \u2014 \nNow \u2014 but \u2014 \nFolks, whether the American people believe what I just said or not may be the whole election. I just want you to know that I believe it. With all my heart, I believe it. \nNow, why do I believe it?\nI'm fixing to tell you why. I believe it because President Obama's approach embodies the values, the ideas and the direction America has to take to build the 21st-century version of the American Dream: a nation of shared opportunities, shared responsibilities, shared prosperity, a shared sense of community.\nSo let's get back to the story. In 2010, as the president's recovery program kicked in, the job losses stopped and things began to turn around. The recovery act saved or created millions of jobs and cut taxes \u2014 let me say this again \u2014 cut taxes for 95 percent of the American people. \nWe could have done better, but last year the Republicans blocked the president's job plan, costing the economy more than a million new jobs.\nSo here's another job score. President Obama: plus 4 1/2 million. Congressional Republicans: zero. \nDuring this period \u2014 It saved \u2014 it saved more than a million jobs, and not just at GM, Chrysler and their dealerships but in auto parts manufacturing all over the country.\nThat's why even the automakers who weren't part of the deal supported it. They needed to save those parts suppliers too. Like I said, we're all in this together. \nSo what's happened? There are now 250,000 more people working in the auto industry than on the day the companies were restructured. \nSo \u2014 now, we all know that Governor Romney opposed the plan to save GM and Chrysler. \u2014 here's another job score: Obama, 250,000; Romney, zero.Now, the agreement the administration made with the management, labor and environmental groups to double car mileage, that was a good deal too. It will cut your gas prices in half, your gas bill. No matter what the price is, if you double the mileage of your car, your bill will be half what it would have been. It will make us more energy independent. It will cut greenhouse gas emissions. And according to several analyses, over the next 20 years, it'll bring us another half a million good new jobs into the American economy. \nThe president's energy strategy, which he calls \"all of the above,\" is helping too. The boom in oil and gas production, combined with greater energy efficiency, has driven oil imports to a near-20- year low and natural gas production to an all-time high. And renewable energy production has doubled.\n\nOf course, we need a lot more new jobs. But there are already more than 3 million jobs open and unfilled in America, mostly because the people who apply for them don't yet have the required skills to do them. So even as we get Americans more jobs, we have to prepare more Americans for the new jobs that are actually going to be created. The old economy is not coming back. We've got to build a new one and educate people to do those jobs. \nThe president \u2014 the president and his education secretary have supported community colleges and employers in working together to train people for jobs that are actually open in their communities \u2014 and even more important after a decade in which exploding college costs have increased the dropout rate so much that the percentage of our young people with four-year college degrees has gone down so much that we have dropped to 16th in the world in the percentage of young people with college degrees.\nSo the president's student loan is more important than ever. Here's what it does \u2014 \nNow what does this mean? What does this mean? Think of it. It means no one will ever have to drop out of college again for fear they can't repay their debt.\nAnd it means \u2014 \nI don't know about you \u2014 \u2014 but on all these issues, I know we're better off because President Obama made the decisions he did.\nNow, that brings me to health care. And the Republicans call it, derisively, \"Obamacare.\" They say it's a government takeover, a disaster, and that if we'll just elect them, they'll repeal it. Well, are they right?Let's take a look at what's actually happened so far.\nFirst, individuals and businesses have already gotten more than a billion dollars in refunds from insurance companies because the new law requires 80 And the gains are even greater than that because a bunch of insurance companies have applied to lower their rates to comply with the requirement.\nSecond, more than 3 million young people between 19 and 25 are insured for the first time because their parents' policies can cover them.\n\nMillions of seniors are receiving preventive care, all the way from breast cancer screenings to tests for heart problems and scores of other things. And younger people are getting them, too.\nFourth, soon the insurance companies \u2014 not the government, the insurance companies \u2014 will have millions of new customers, many of them middle-class people with pre-existing conditions who never could get insurance before. \nNow, finally, listen to this. For the last two years \u2014 after going up at three times the rate of inflation for a decade, for the last two years health care costs have been under 4 percent in both years for the first time in 50 years. \nSo let me ask you something. Are we better off because President Obama fought for health care reform? You bet we are.\nNow, there were two other attacks on the president in Tampa I think deserve an answer. First, both Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan attacked the president for allegedly robbing Medicare of $716 billion. That's the same attack they leveled against the Congress in 2010, and they got a lot of votes on it. But it's not true. \nLook, here's what really happened. You be the judge. Here's what really happened. There were no cuts to benefits at all. None. What the president did was to save money by taking the recommendations of a commission of professionals to cut unwarranted subsidies to providers and insurance companies that were not making people healthier and were not necessary to get the providers to provide the service.\nAnd instead of raiding Medicare, he used the savings to close the doughnut hole in the Medicare drug program \u2014 \nSo \u2014 \nSo \u2014 \u2014 now, you're having a good time, but this is getting serious, and I want you to listen.\nIt's important, because a lot of people believe this stuff.\nNow, at least on this issue, on this one issue, Governor Romney has been consistent. \nHe wants to go back to the old system, which means we'll reopen the doughnut hole and force seniors to pay more for drugs, and we'll reduce the life of the Medicare trust fund by eight full years. \nSo if he's elected, and if he does what he promised to do, Medicare will now grow \nNow, folks, this is serious, because it gets worse. And you won't be laughing when I finish telling you this. They also want to block-grant Medicaid, and cut it by a third over the coming 10 years.Of course, that's going to really hurt a lot of poor kids. But that's not all. Lot of folks don't know it, but nearly two-thirds of Medicaid is spent on nursing home care for Medicare seniors \u2014 \u2014 who are eligible for Medicaid.\nAnd honestly, let's think about it, if that happens, I don't know what those families are going to do.\nSo I know what I'm going to do. I'm going to do everything I can to see that it doesn't happen. We can't let it happen. Let's look \u2014Let's look at the other big charge the Republicans made. It's a real doozy. Nobody ever tells you what really happened \u2014 here's what happened.\nWhen some Republican governors asked if they could have waivers to try new ways to put people on welfare back to work, the Obama administration listened because we all know it's hard for even people with good work histories to get jobs today. So moving folks from welfare to work is a real challenge.\nAnd the administration agreed to give waivers to those governors and others only if they had a credible plan to increase employment by 20 percent, and they could keep the waivers only if they did increase employment. Now, did I make myself clear? The requirement was for more work, not less. \nSo this is personal to me. We moved millions of people off welfare. It was one of the reasons that in the eight years I was president, we had a hundred times as many people move out of poverty into the middle class than happened under the previous 12 years, a hundred times as many. \nBut they keep on running the ads claiming it. You want to know why? Their campaign pollster said, we are not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact-checkers. \nAnd I hope you and every American within the sound of my voice remembers it every time they see one of those ads, and it turns into an ad to re-elect Barack Obama and keep the fundamental principles of personal empowerment and moving everybody who can get a job into work as soon as we can. \nNow, let's talk about the debt. Today, interest rates are low, lower than the rate of inflation. People are practically paying us to borrow money, to hold their money for them.\nBut it will become a big problem when the economy grows and interest rates start to rise. We've got to deal with this big long- term debt problem or it will deal with us. It will gobble up a bigger and bigger percentage of the federal budget we'd rather spend on education and health care and science and technology. It \u2014 we've got to deal with it.\nNow, what has the president done? He has offered a reasonable plan of $4 trillion in debt reduction over a decade, with 2 1/2 trillion coming from \u2014 for every $2 1/2 trillion in spending cuts, he raises a dollar in new revenues \u2014 2 1/2-to-1. And he has tight controls on future spending. That's the kind of balanced approach proposed by the Simpson-Bowles Commission, a bipartisan commission.\nNow, I think this plan is way better than Governor Romney's plan. First, the Romney plan failed the first test of fiscal responsibility. The numbers just don't add up. \nI mean, consider this. What would you do if you had this problem? Somebody says, oh, we've got a big debt problem. We've got to reduce the debt. So what's the first thing you say we're going to do? Well, to reduce the debt, we're going to have another $5 trillion in tax cuts heavily weighted to upper-income people. So we'll make the debt hole bigger before we start to get out of it.\nNow, when you say, what are you going to do about this $5 trillion you just added on? They say, oh, we'll make it up by eliminating loopholes in the tax code.\nSo then you ask, well, which loopholes, and how much?\nYou know what they say? See me about that after the election. \nI'm not making it up. That's their position. See me about that after the election.\nNow, people ask me all the time how we got four surplus budgets in a row. What new ideas did we bring to Washington? I always give a one-word answer: Arithmetic. \nIf \u2014 arithmetic! If \u2014 \nOr, two, they'll have to cut so much spending that they'll obliterate the budget for the national parks, for ensuring clean air, clean water, safe food, safe air travel. They'll cut way back on Pell Grants, college loans, early childhood education, child nutrition programs, all the programs that help to empower middle-class families and help poor kids. Oh, they'll cut back on investments in roads and bridges and science and technology and biomedical research.\nThat's what they'll do. They'll hurt the middle class and the poor and put the future on hold to give tax cuts to upper-income people who've been getting it all along.\nOr three, in spite of all the rhetoric, they'll just do what they've been doing for more than 30 years. They'll go in and cut the taxes way more than they cut spending, especially with that big defense increase, and they'll just explode the debt and weaken the economy. And they'll destroy the federal government's ability to help you by letting interest gobble up all your tax payments.\nDon't you ever forget when you hear them talking about this that Republican economic policies quadrupled the national debt before I took office, in the 12 years before I took office \u2014 It's arithmetic.\nWe simply cannot afford to give the reins of government to someone who will double down on trickle down. Really. Think about this: President Obama \u2014 President Obama's plan cuts the debt, honors our values, brightens the future of our children, our families and our nation. It's a heck of a lot better.\nIt passes the arithmetic test, and far more important, it passes the values test. \nMy fellow Americans, all of us in this grand hall and everybody watching at home, when we vote in this election, we'll be deciding what kind of country we want to live in. If you want a winner-take- all, you're-on-your-own society, you should support the Republican ticket. But if you want a country of shared opportunities and shared responsibility, a we're-all-in-this-together society, you should vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden. If you \u2014 if you want \u2014If you want America \u2014 if you want every American to vote and you think it is wrong to change voting procedures \u2014 \nAnd if you think \u2014 if you think the president was right to open the doors of American opportunity to all those young immigrants brought here when they were young so they can serve in the military or go to college, you must vote for Barack Obama. If you want a future of shared prosperity, where the middle class is growing and poverty is declining, where the American dream is really alive and well again and where the United States maintains its leadership as a force for peace and justice and prosperity in this highly competitive world, you have to vote for Barack Obama.\n\nLook, I love our country so much. And I know we're coming back. For more than 200 years, through every crisis, we've always come back. We come through ever fire a little stronger and a little better.\nAnd we do it because in the end we decide to champion the cause for which our founders pledged their lives, their fortunes, their sacred honor \u2014 the cause of forming a more perfect union. ", "Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm Elizabeth Warren, and this is my first Democratic convention.\nI \u2014OK, now, enough. \nI want to give a special shoutout to the Massachusetts delegation. I'm counting on you to help me win and to help President Obama win.\nI'm here tonight to talk about hardworking people, people who get up early, stay up late, cook dinner and help out with homework, people who can be counted on to help their kids, their parents, their neighbors and the lady down the street whose car broke down, people who work their hearts out but are up against a hard truth: The game is rigged against them.\nIt wasn't always this way. Like a lot of you, I grew up in a family on the ragged edge of the middle class. My daddy sold carpeting and ended up as a maintenance man. After he had a heart attack, my mom worked the phones at Sears so we could hang onto our house. All three of my brothers served in the military. One was career \u2014 \u2014 and the third started a small business.\nMe, I was waiting tables at 13 and married at 19. I graduated from public schools and taught elementary school. \nI grew up in an America that invested in its kids and built a strong middle class, that allowed millions of children to rise from poverty and establish secure lives, an America that created Social Security and Medicare so that seniors could live with dignity \u2014 \nBut now for many years, our middle class has been chipped, squeezed and hammered. Talk to the construction worker I met from Malden, Massachusetts, who went nine months without finding work. Talk to the head of a manufacturing company in Franklin trying to protect jobs, but worried about rising costs. Talk to the student in Worcester who worked hard to finish his degree, and now he's drowning in debt. Their fight is my fight. And it's Barack Obama's fight too. \nThat's right. Yes. \nPeople feel like the system is rigged against them. And here's the painful part. They're right. The system is rigged.\nLook around. Oil companies guzzle down billions in profits. Billionaires pay lower tax rates than their secretaries. And Wall Street CEOs \u2014 the same ones who wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs \u2014 still strut around Congress, no shame, demanding favors and acting like we should thank them. Does anyone here have a problem with that?Well, I do too. I do too.\nI talk to small-business owners all across Massachusetts, and not one of them, not one made big bucks from the risky bets that brought down our economy. I talk to nurses and programmers, salespeople and firefighters, people who bust their tails every day, and not one of them \u2014 not one \u2014 stashes their money in the Cayman Islands to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. \nThese folks don't \u2014 \nWe've fought to level the playing field before. About a century ago, when corrosive greed threatened our economy and our way of life, the American people came together, under the leadership of Teddy Roosevelt and other progressives, to bring our nation back from the brink. We started to take children out of factories and put them in schools.\n\nAmericans are fighters. We're tough, resourceful and creative. And if we have the chance to fight on a level playing field where everyone pays a fair share and everyone has a real shot, then no one, no one can stop us. \nPresident Obama gets it because he's spent his life fighting for the middle class. And now he's fighting to level that playing field because we know the economy doesn't grow from the top down but from the middle class out and the bottom up. That's how we create jobs and reduce the debt. \nAnd Mitt Romney \u2014 \nThe Republican vision is clear: I got mine; the rest of you are on your own. \nRepublicans say they don't believe in government. Sure they do. They believe in government to help themselves and their powerful friends. \nAfter all, Mitt Romney's the guy who said corporations are people. \nAfter the financial crisis, President Obama knew that we had to clean up Wall Street. For years, families had been tricked by credit cards, fooled by student loans and cheated on mortgages.\nI had an idea for a consumer financial protection agency to stop the rip-off. Now, the big banks sure didn't like it. And they marshalled one of the biggest lobbying forces on earth to destroy the agency before it ever saw the light of day.\nAmerican families didn't have an army of lobbyists on our side.\nWhat we had was a president \u2014 \nAnd when the lobbyists were closing in for the kill, Barack Obama squared his shoulders, planted his feet and stood firm. And that's how we won. \nPresident Obama believes in a level playing field. He believes in a country where nobody gets a free ride or a golden parachute, a country where anyone who has a great idea and rolls up their sleeves has a chance to build a business and anyone who works had can build some security and raise a family. President Obama believes in a country where billionaires pay their taxes just like their secretaries did \u2014 He believes in a country where everyone is held accountable, where no one can steal your purse on Main Street our your pension on Wall Street.\n\nPresident Obama believes in a country where we invest in education, in roads and bridges, in science and in the future, so we can create new opportunities so the next kid can make it big, and the kid after that, and the kid after that. \nI grew up \u2014 I grew up in the Methodist church and taught Sunday school. And one of my favorite passages of scripture is, \"In as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me,\" Matthew 25:40. The passage teaches about God in each of us, that we are bound to each other and we are called to act \u2014 not to sit, not to wait, but to act \u2014 all of us together.\nSenator Ted Kennedy understood that call. Four years ago, he addressed our convention for the last time. He said, we have never lost our beliefs that we are all called to a better country and a newer world. Generation after generation, Americans have answered that call. And now we are called again.\nWe are called to restore opportunity for every American. We are called to give America's working families a fighting chance. We are called to build something solid so the next generation can build something better. \nSo let me ask you \u2014 let me ask you, America: Are you ready to answer this call? ", "Good evening, everyone. My name's Jim Sinegal, and I'm here tonight to share my story with you. I grew up in Pittsburgh, where my father worked in a steel mill. \nI graduated from a public high school, attended a community college and a state university. My first job was as a retail warehouse.\nAnd then three decades ago, a friend and I had a big idea for a small business, one that we would start in Seattle, Washington. A warehouse store that would provide our members with great products and low prices while treating our employees fairly.\nToday, our small company has been blessed with success \u2014 huge success. I might say, bulk success. \nIn Tampa last week, we heard all about job creators. But at our company, we recognize that job creation requires time and investment and commitment to the long term. It requires companies that plant, then grow; not executives who reap and run. That's how we do our part to build an economy that lasts.At Costco, we've created over 116,000 American jobs. \u2014 benefit and health care packages that are second to none.\n\nAt Costco, we know a thing or two about what it takes for business to succeed, for a company to do well by its shareholders and do the right thing for its employees at the same time. \nSome of my friends in corporate America say that they need a government that gets off the backs of businesses. And that's why many of them are supporting the opposition with donations of hundreds of thousands of dollars. \nAnd that's why I'm here tonight supporting President Obama, a \u2014 \u2014 a president making an economy built to last. See, in order for companies like Costco to invest, grow, hire, and flourish, the conditions have to be right.\nThat requires something from all of us.\nAnd if you ask the innovative growth companies across the country, they'll tell you exactly what that something is. They'll tell you America needs to be a nation with the best education system so that workers \u2014 \u2014 so that workers can get the training they need to join or stay in the middle class.\nAmerica also needs to be a nation that spurs research and innovation so that our products and industries of tomorrow are invented here at home.\nAmerica needs to be a nation with an affordable energy of all kinds so companies can keep their costs down and their production lines humming and their products moving. America also needs to be a nation with the safest, most efficient transportation systems \u2014 \u2014 so people can \u2014 and goods can connect with opportunities and markets.\nAmerica needs to be a nation that pays down its debt in a balanced way so businesses have a predictable environment in which to plan, invest and to trade.\nAmerica needs to be a nation with a sensible immigration laws \u2014 \u2014 laws that are humane and practical, laws that help businesses retain qualified employees.\nAnd America needs to be a nation where everyone follows the same set of rules of the road \u2014 \u2014 so that small businesses can compete with the big and so that small businesses can become big, so that breakthrough ideas and hard work are rewarded more than speculation, so that more startups succeed and fewer bubbles burst. These are the investments that business wants.\nThese are the building blocks of President Obama's plan for the future, and that's why I'm proud to stand with him. \nThree decades ago, my business partner and I started a company. We sacrificed, we struggled, we risked our own money, we relied on ourselves. Our initiative, our enterprise \u2014 this, in part, is why our company succeeded.\nBut here's the thing about the Costco story. We did not build our company in a vacuum. We built it in the greatest country on earth. We built our company in a place where anyone can make it with hard work, a little luck and a little help from their neighbors and their country.\nI'm here tonight because Costco's story is the American story, because it's the story that President Obama is helping millions of dreamers and doers to write anew for themselves. And I'm here tonight because I believe he deserves four more years to help us write the next chapter. Thank you very much.", "Some of you \u2014 \u2014 even though they were debating an issue that affects nearly every woman. Because it happened in Congress, people noticed. But it happens all the time. Too many women are shut out and silenced. So while I'm honored to be standing at this podium, it easily could have been any one of you.\nI'm here because I spoke out. And this November, each of us must speak out.\nDuring this campaign, we've heard about two profoundly different futures that could await women in this country and how one of those futures looks like an offensive, obsolete relic of our past. Warnings of that future are not distractions. They are not imagined. That future could become real.\nIn that America, your new president could be a man who stands by when a public figure tries to silence a private citizen with hateful slurs \u2014 \nIt would be an America in which you have a new vice president who co-sponsored a bill that would allow pregnant women to die preventable deaths in our emergency rooms \u2014 \u2014 in which someone decides which domestic violence victim deserves access to services and which don't.\nWe know what this America would look like. And in a few short months that's the America that we could be. But that's not the America that we should be, and it's not who we are. \nWe've also seen another America that we could choose. In that America, we'd have the right to choose. \u2014 and you give me this microphone to amplify our voice.\nThat's the difference.\nOver the last six months, I've seen what these two futures look like. And six months from now, we're all going to be living in one future or the other \u2014 but only one: a country where our president either has our backs or turns his back \u2014 \u2014 or one where that freedom doesn't apply to our bodies or to our voices.\nWe talk often about choice. Well, ladies and gentlemen \u2014 ", "Four more years.\nA week ago today, Paul Ryan accepted his party's nomination for vice president. He's the chairman of the House Budget Committee. I lead the Democrats on the committee. We have sharp differences over policy, but we get along well.\nAnd I'll admit, I was glad Paul was picked. I hoped it would result in a serious debate about the choice before us. Then I heard his acceptance speech. It kept the fact-checkers up all night. \nYou remember the Republicans had this gigantic clock in the arena showing the size of the national debt. And Paul told America, if you elect Republicans, we can fix that. But if Paul Ryan was being honest, he would have pointed to that debt clock and said, we built that. \nBecause \u2014 because here are the facts. When President Clinton left office, America had a projected surplus of trillions of dollars over the next decade.\nThen came two wars, two tax cuts tilted to the wealthy and a new entitlement. Republicans didn't pay for any of it. Paul Ryan voted for all of it. \nOn top of that, they left behind an economy in free fall. So when President Obama took office, the Republicans handed him the bill: projected deficits of trillions of dollars. Congressman Ryan, America is literally in your debt. \nSo President Obama went to work. He established a bipartisan commission to get smart folks from both parties together to develop a plan to reduce the deficit and to grow jobs. And guess what? It worked. They produced a balanced, bipartisan plan that would cut 4 trillion from the deficit. You know, lots of Republicans voted for it, including Senator Coburn from Oklahoma. And Paul Ryan \u2014 Paul Ryan \u2014 Paul Ryan was on that commission. He voted against the plan. And last week Paul Ryan criticized the president for not acting on the bipartisan plan that he himself opposed.\nThen he said President Obama doesn't have a plan to reduce the deficit.\nBut the president does have a plan. Here it is, right here in my hand. The president submitted this plan to the Congress. It's on the Internet. President Obama's plan uses the bipartisan commission's balanced approach. It reduces the deficit by more than $4 trillion, cutting spending and asking those at the top to pay the same rates they did under President Clinton \u2014 when we created nearly 23 million jobs and balanced the budget. \nSo when Paul Ryan told America that President Obama didn't have a plan, that was false. The truth is he and Mitt Romney just don't like the president's plan. They both pledged \u2014 they pledged that they would never \u2014 never \u2014 ask millionaires to pay one more dime to reduce our deficit. Mitt Romney even said he would reject a budget with $10 in spending cuts for every $1 in new revenue.\nAnd now a third grader can do the math. If you refuse to ask the wealthiest to pitch in, then you hit everybody else much harder. And that's exactly what the Romney-Ryan plan does. You know, they call their plan brave, bold, courageous. I ask all of you, is it bold to give millionaires another tax cut while forcing seniors to pay more for Medicare?Is it brave to reward companies that ship jobs overseas while cutting education here at home?And is it courageous to raise taxes on middle- class families while giving tax cuts to people with Swiss bank accounts?Look, Mitt Romney's and Paul Ryan's obsession with tax breaks for the wealthy is part of a rigid ideology: Give people like Mitt Romney a break and hope something will trickle down and lift others up.\nBut this theory crashed in the real world. We all lived through the recession, when jobs went down and the deficit went up. So when they say they'll turn around the economy, beware. They mean a U-turn back to the failed theory that lifted the yachts while the other boats ran aground. \nAnd don't buy the lie that asking the wealthy to contribute more is about punishing success. It's about asking them to share responsibility for reducing the deficit. \nThis election is a choice. That choice will determine whether America is a place where people climb the ladder of opportunity and pull it up behind them or whether America is a place where people who reach the top help the next person up.\nWhich America do you believe in? You know the facts, you know the choice and you know what we have to do: re-elect Barack Obama. ", "We just heard from Bob King about President Obama's record of creating jobs. I want to tell you about Mitt Romney's record of cutting jobs. \nIt came without any warning. They rushed in the security guards to walk us out of our plant. We weren't even allowed to take our personal items. They handed us job applications and told us: If we want you, we'll let you know. Now, the truth is, some folks were hired back \u2014 lower wages, fewer benefits, no retirement \u2014 \nWhat affected me most was having guys the age I am now come to my desk and cry \u2014 guys who had nothing to fall back on. I don't think Mitt Romney's a bad man. I don't fault him for the fact that some companies win and some companies lose. That's a fact of life. What I fault him for is making money without a moral compass. \nI fault him for putting profit before people like me.\nWhen Mitt Romney first announced he was running for president, I had no idea who he was. But then I learned he was the CEO of Bain Capital, and that sure got my attention real fast.\nI used to work at a plant in Miami that Governor Romney bought with his partners from Bain. I say \"used to\" because not long after they bought it, Romney and his partners shut our plant down and ultimately drove our company into bankruptcy. Our \u2014 \nIt was a really difficult time for me and for my co-workers but not for Governor Romney and his partners. While we watched our jobs disappear, they ultimately walked away with more than $240 million. Of course, I understand. Some companies are successful; others are not. That's the way our economy works. But it is wrong when dedicated, productive employees feel the pain while folks like Mitt Romney make profits.\nSo when Mitt Romney talks about his business experience, remember \u2014 it is not experience creating good-paying jobs. It is experience cutting jobs. It is experience shutting plants. It is experience making millions of dollars by making life tougher for hard-working Americans.\nThat is not the kind of experience we need in the White House. We need a president who will create good-paying jobs and make sure everyone has a fair chance. We need President Barack Obama. Good evening. Good evening, and a special greeting to my fellow Minnesotans and to the hard- working Missourians that I was privileged to represent for so many years.\nI'm David Foster, and I was a steelworker for 31 years. For 15 years I laid brick and tapped the furnaces and did all that hard, dirty work to turn molten metal into the cars and bridges and buildings that make America what it is today. And I \u2014 and I also led the steelworkers in a 13-state region, including GST Steel in Kansas City, a 100-year-old company that was bought by Mitt Romney and his partners at Bain Capital in 1993.\nNow, it's a story that I wish I didn't have to tell, but America needs to know the truth. When Romney and Bain took over the mill, they loaded it up with millions in debt, and within months they used some of that borrowed money to pay themselves millions. Within a decade, the debt kept growing and was so large the company was forced into bankruptcy. They fired 750 steelworkers while they pocketed $12 million in profits. A steelworker at GST would have had to work 240 years to make $12 million.\nSo in 2001, with GST bankrupt and Romney still CEO of Bain, I had to stand in a rented auditorium in front of hundreds of steelworkers in their 50s and 60s, retirees and widows in their 70s and 80s, and tell them Romney and Bain had broken their promises. Jobs, vacation pay, severance, health insurance, pension benefits that were promised \u2014 they were all gone.\nNow, some companies succeed \u2014 some companies succeed, others fail. I know that. But I also know this. We don't need a president who fires steelworkers, or says let Detroit go bankrupt. \nWe need the leadership \u2014 we need the leadership of a man who, during the darkest hours for America's auto industry, rolled up his sleeves, risked his presidency and saved over 1 million good auto jobs. We need \u2014 we need Barack Obama.\nThank you. ", "The first woman to serve in both houses of the Congress was Margaret Chase Smith \u2014 \u2014 and she said, \"The right way is not always the popular and the easy way.\" Standing for right when it's unpopular is a true test of moral character. Margaret Chase Smith was a Republican, but a very different kind than those Republicans trying to overtake our country now.\nIn some of America's darkest economic days since the Great Depression and in the face of tremendous political venom, President Obama met the test of moral character. He stood up for what \u2014 not for what was popular and easy, but for what was right. \u2014 who, if the \u2014 who, if the industry went under, would not be able to put food on the table.\nWe all remember what those days were like when President Obama took office \u2014 workers waiting anxiously as their companies announced layoffs, banks refusing to loan, car sales were collapsing.\nIt wasn't just auto companies that were struggling to survive, so were those companies making parts and selling cars. Small businesses that relied on auto workers as customers, like diners and barber shops, had to close down. Unfortunately, most Republicans advocated doing nothing. And what did Mitt Romney say? You all know this. He said: Let Detroit go bankrupt. \nIn strong \u2014 in strong contrast, President Obama took action, putting together a rescue team demanding real change and real sacrifice from everyone involved \u2014 from management, from labor, from suppliers, from debt holders, from dealers \u2014 everybody involved. It was not universally popular but it was absolutely right. \nPresident Obama's strong leadership saved a million jobs. Since June of 2009, this industry has added a quarter of a million jobs. And the auto industry is thriving again. These are good middle-class jobs in glass, in plastics, in steel \u2014 jobs making things for an economy built to last.\n\nAnd Mitt Romney's record at Bain Capital \u2014 the corporate buy-out firm he founded too often has made their money not by building companies up but by taking them apart. And too often, the workers ended up in the streets even as Romney and his partners made millions of dollars.\nEarlier this week, we celebrated Labor Day. Many people forget what this holiday \u2014 and why it was created. What this holiday is. It was about safe workplaces, health care, the 40-hour work week, middle-class jobs. Standards that all of us believe in. \nBut these standards did not just happen. They happened because generations of working people fought for \u2014 and in some cases, died for \u2014 the right to organize \u2014 \nPresident Obama strongly supports these basic human rights, because these rights are good for all Americans. Strong unions and collective bargaining \u2014 \u2014 strong unions and collective bargaining have lifted millions of people out of poverty and built the great American middle class.\n\nI am so proud to be a union member.

Bueno.\nLike most Latinas, you know that I'm not afraid to speak my mind. \nAh, but this year is very different. If 2008 was an important election, it's nothing compared to 2012. Nothing. Thank you.\nLike Benita, I know what it's like to come to this country at a young age. I was 12 years old when, like so many Cubans, my parents fled the Castro regime.Viva Cuba.\nFor us, America meant freedom.

And that's what I did.Si se puede.\nEven though I could not afford to finish college, I got an internship job in Vanidades magazine, and I turned that internship into a job, and that job into a business and a television show, \"El Show de Cristina,\" that ended up with a hundred million viewers in 40 different countries.\nFor me \u2014 muchas gracias. For me \u2014 que si se puede, se puede \u2014 .\nFor me, the American promise \u2014 because it's not just a dream; it's a promise \u2014 isn't just an idea. It's not a theory. It's my life story and of many \"DREAMers.\" I want to pass that promise on to my grandchildren, Dominic \nAnd that is what this election is about, mi gente, mi gente. For the first time in my life \u2014 the first time in my life, the promise of America is in danger. Nearly every part of Governor Romney's plan would put that American dream further out of reach.\nIn order to cut taxes for those at the very top, he would raise taxes for middle-class families, slash education and cut student aid. Governor Romney will turn Medicare from a guarantee into una libreta de coupones, a book of coupons. \nWe need to re-elect our President Obama. Our president is an incredible man.\nHe fights for us every single day. He helped prevent a second Great Depression. He cut taxes for middle-class families and small businesses. He fought for health care reform, which is already helping millions of Americans afford insurance. \nHis education policies mean Hispanics will receive an estimated 150,000 more college scholarships. \nYes. And he knows we still have a lot of work to do. President Obama has a detailed plan. You can find his plan right on his website. It's a plan to grow our economy from the middle class out and the bottom up, not from the top down. A plan to invent \u2014 invest in education, a plan to invest in manufacturing and a plan to pass comprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship. Thank you.\nOn immigration, Governor Romney's views \u2014 this really freaked me out \u2014 his views could not be more extreme. He says that we should make life so unbearable for 11 million people that they simply self- deport. \nDon't boo \u2014 vote. OK.\nHe even \u2014 he even made the architect of that horrible law an immigration adviser for his campaign.\nThat was really smart. No protesting, voting \u2014 vote. And of course, he has promised to repeal the DREAM Act.\nThis election is about many things, but if you want to understand the values of the two candidates, all you have to do is think about Benita \u2014 the beautiful lady that introduced me tonight. Governor Romney calls young people like her, at 27, illegal aliens. President Obama calls them dreamers. And that is the difference in this election.\nSo in closing, I'm asking to all mi gente, toda mi gente, all of my people to please join me. Many of us come from countries where votes are not counted properly. In fact, they're not counted at all. That begins with making sure you are registered to vote.\nSo I want you to go to gottavote.com \u2014 and in Spanish that's votemostodos.com. They have everything you need to get registered. Make sure your friends and family are registered too. And, Charlotte, let me ask you a question, girlfriend, esta con nosotros, Charlotte? \nAre you in? Will you register voters?

We look out for each other not just because we're GM or because we're Ohioans, but we're Americans. \nWhen the auto industry was on its last legs, I was laid off, and I was terrified. How was I going to provide for my daughter and my two boys or pay my mortgage? How was the Mahoning Valley going to survive when so many of us were out of work, when so many could lose what they worked so hard for?\nThe answer wasn't obvious, and the solution wasn't popular. But President Obama didn't think about the polls or the politics. He thought about the people. And because he put himself in our shoes, we're back on our feet.\nSome said we shouldn't rescue the auto industry. \nToday I'm back at work. \nPresident Obama has the same work ethic and values as my co- workers at GM, my neighbors in Ohio. And he knows we're all in this together. He believed in us. He stood up for us. And I am proud and honored to stand here tonight for him.\nThank you very much. Thank you.", "When we first started CarMax 19 years ago, we had a simple idea to make buying a used car transparent, easy and an honest process. And today CarMax has grown to be America's largest auto retailer, employing 17,000 people in 30 states, and it's also one of Fortune's top 100 companies to work for.\nWe worked hard to build and conceive an idea for CarMax, but we didn't do it alone. We succeeded because we had intensely committed associates, healthy and flexible capital markets, good roads and bridges that let us move products rapidly and cooperative federal, state and local governments that helped us have clear rules of the road and plan and grow our business.\nAs a businessman, I know President Obama understands what it takes to spark economic growth because I've seen him in action. When he took office, he inherited a massive structural deficit from his Republican predecessor, an economy in free fall and, most importantly for me personally, an auto industry on the verge of collapse.\nThe president's decisive action led to rapid and successful restructuring of two of America's largest corporations, GM and Chrysler.\nThat didn't just save the car companies; it helped prevent a domino effect that would have taken down everything in the auto industry, from factories that manufactured auto parts to the dealers who sold the cars.\nHe also launched targeted efforts that helped ordinary people buy cars again. All together, these actions prevented over a million job losses and laid the groundwork for what's now a robust recovery of the American auto industry. \nAs a \u2014 as a businessman who focuses on facts, not political rhetoric, I think the choice in this election is clear. President Obama has shown he has the vision to support average consumers and taxpayers. He understands that the consumer is the engine of economic growth, that businesses can't prosper without them. That's why he has a plan to reduce the deficit, to invest in infrastructure and education, to give tax relief and benefits to average consumers, not the millionaires \u2014 because that's what works. That's how we grow the economy from the middle out, not from the top down.\nAs a businessman, I'll tell you, Mitt Romney just doesn't get it. Thank you.", "My name is Benita Veliz, and I'm from San Antonio, Texas. I went on to earn a double major at the age of 20.\n\nI know I have something to contribute to my economy and my country.

", "On behalf of the great state of California \u2014 \nSo let's get right down to business. We are here because we love our country. And we firmly believe in the American ideal that our country should work for everyone. That ideal is written into our laws, the rules of the road that create a level playing field in this country. Those are the rules I became attorney general to uphold. And those are the rules Mitt Romney would have us roll back.\nHe would roll back the rules that protect the air we breathe and the water we drink, roll back the rules that protect the health and safety of women and families, roll back the rules that prevent the kind of recklessness that got our economy into this mess in the first place.\nWell, I've seen all that happens when you roll back those rules. What happens are rows of foreclosure signs. What happens are mountains of family debt. What happens is a middle class that's hurting. That's what we've seen in towns across California and across this country.\nWhen it comes to the housing crisis, the choice between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney is clear. The fact is, we don't have to guess what Miss Romney \u2014 Mitt Romney would have done if he were president, because he told us. He said we should let foreclosures, and I quote, hit the bottom \u2014 Run its course.\nThat's not leadership. Doing nothing while the middle class is hurting \u2014 that's not leadership. Loose regulations and lax enforcement \u2014 that's not leadership. That's abandoning our middle class.\nHere's what President Obama did. President Obama won Wall Street reform to prevent any more tax-funded bailouts. President Obama won credit card reform so you don't get stuck with hidden fees and sudden rate hikes.\n\nWe need to move forward. President Obama will fight for working families. He will fight to level the economic playing field and fight to give every American the same fair shot my family had.\nI remember when my mother, Shyamala Harris, bought our first home. I was 13. She was so proud. And my sister and I were so excited. Millions of families and millions of Americans know that feeling of walking through the front door of their own home for the first time, the feeling of reaching for opportunity and finding it. \nThat's the choice in this election. It's a choice between an America where opportunity is open to everyone, where everyone plays by the same set of rules, or a philosophy that tilts the playing field to help the wealthiest few, a choice between holding Wall Street accountable or letting it write its own rules. Mitt Romney subscribes to the cynical logic that says the American dream belongs to some of us and not all of us.\nWell, I'll tell you who the American dream belongs to.\nIt belongs to the student in Sacramento who doesn't have much money but who goes to bed each night dreaming big dreams. It belongs to the men and women across this country who know it shouldn't be against the law to marry the person you love. \nThe American dream belongs to all of us. And if we can work together and stand together and vote together on November 6th for President Barack Obama, that's a dream we will put within reach of all our people. Thank you.

I think a lot of small- business owners feel the same way. We don't care about the daily back-and-forth of campaigns. We just want leaders in Washington who believe in us and make it a little easier for us to succeed. Our president is that kind of leader. \nThere were moments when my wife, Karen, and I wondered if we would ever get our business off the ground. I remember what it was like to go to bank after bank after bank hearing no. We may not have ever gotten to yes if it wasn't for President Obama and the SBA loan program that he started. For these last four years I've had a president who's on my side. He cut small business taxes 18 times. He kept middle-class taxes low, which meant more customers for my product.\nHe knows that growing the middle class helps businesses create jobs. And I know that if he gets a second term, entrepreneurs like me will have the best possible chance to succeed. \nI hear \u2014 I hear President Obama has been brewing some beer in the White House recently \u2014 \nOur president has fought for small-business owners, and now it's time to fight for him. Thank you, everybody. ", "Hello, delegates, especially those from my home state, the great state of Maine. \nFrom day one, President Obama has made small business a top priority in his White House, giving them the tools they need to turn their dreams into small businesses and their small businesses into world-class companies, giving them help and then getting out of their way.\nYou know, President Obama understand that small businesses is the backbone of the economy. After all, half of all Americans who work own or work for a small business. They create two-thirds of all new jobs. Small businesses are a big part of who we are.\nYou know, when President Obama took office, the economy was in free fall. Credit was frozen. Small businesses weren't thinking about expansion, they were thinking about survival. The president knew that one of the most important things he could do was give small businesses a fighting chance.\nSo he took action. Right away, President Obama cut small business taxes, not once or twice, but 18 times. He put a record volume of guaranteed loans into the hands of America's small businesses. He eliminated pages of burdensome forms and regulations so small businesses could focus on profits instead of paperwork. And he made the federal government pay small-business contractors not in 30 days but in 15 to help entrepreneurs make their payrolls and buy new equipment. He even gave small business a seat at the table in his Cabinet.\nToday small-business owners are having very different conversations than they were three and a half years ago. Today they're talking about strategies to fill larger orders, blueprints for bigger factories and plans to hire more workers, like Raleigh Denim, a husband-and-wife team making blue jeans right here in North Carolina \u2014 \u2014 and exporting them to eight countries on three continents.\nAmerica's entrepreneurs, like Raleigh Denim, are our greatest asset, and President Obama has delivered for them. He understands that Washington doesn't create jobs, small businesses do. The government's role is to put the wind at their backs. And after the worst storm in generations, that's exactly what President Obama is doing, expanding access and opportunity in every corner of all 50 states.\n", "I am privileged to be the governor of Delaware \u2014 Joe has never forgotten his middle-class roots or the lessons he learned. And you know what? Mitt Romney hasn't forgotten his roots or the lessons he's learned either. And that's what worries me about Mitt Romney.\nMitt Romney says that he should be president because he was a business executive. Now, I've got nothing against business executives running for office. After all, I am one. Before I entered public life, I earned my MBA at night while working during the day. I helped lead the wireless revolution at Nextel and grew with it from 13 to 3,000 employees. I am a proud, card-carrying capitalist. And make no mistake, I believe in private equity, which helped back Nextel.\nBut as someone who has been a businessman and a governor, let me level with you.\nJust because Mitt Romney was a successful private equity executive, that does not mean he deserves to be president. \nAs an executive in private equity, Mitt Romney's focus was on the bottom line. And that makes sense. His constituents were his financial shareholders. When he closed factories and sent jobs overseas, it was to benefit his shareholders. That was his job, and he was good at it.\nBut when you're a governor, or the president, it's different. Your shareholders are teachers, construction workers and hardware store owners. \nWhen your constituents are your financial shareholders, perhaps it makes sense to take control of the company, to suffocate it with debt and get rid of the workers' pensions. That kind of thing worked for Mitt Romney when he sat in his corporate office, but it won't work for the country if Mitt Romney is sitting in the Oval Office. \nMitt Romney saw the death of Detroit as good for investors.\nHe couldn't see what the auto industry meant for the millions of middle-class families who depend on those jobs.\nAnd Barack Obama, he immediately understood what was at stake. He saw saving the auto industry as good for his shareholders, the American people. \nNow, luckily, we have a choice, a clear choice, in this election. President Obama understands that while government alone cannot create jobs, it sure can create an environment for companies to grow and invest and hire. And that's why President Obama has a plan to create jobs and build a strong economy to last. And you can read it for yourself at barackobama.com/plan.\nNow, every day, President Obama is working for the men and women of the middle class who do the hard work of this great nation, investing in you, your education, your job skills and the roads and the bridges we all depend on.\nNow, when I began as governor, I received a phone call no governor wants to get. One of our top employers, a refinery, was planning to shut down and lay off all the workers.\nIn fact, they did just that. And days after the plant closed, I visited the workers. And I could see in their eyes that they were not ready to quit, and I promised that I would fight for them. \nSo I worked with labor, with investors, with the talented new management all committed to keeping the refinery running, and we saved those jobs. \nYou see, my shareholders were those refinery workers. And I had to deliver for them.\nNow let me ask you. What do you think Mitt Romney would have done if that call came in?\nWell, Mitt Romney already told us what he would do. Mitt Romney says he likes to fire people. \nYou know, from the moment he took office, President Obama has delivered for the middle class. He believes that we need to grow our economy from the middle out and not from the top down. That we \u2014 that we need to keep America a land of middle-class opportunity. And to keep faith with that promise, the promise of America, it is up to us. We must work for it. We must fight for it. And we must re-elect President Obama one more time. ", "Good evening. I'm Sister Simone Campbell, and I'm one of the Nuns on the Bus. \nLet me explain why I'm here tonight. In June I joined other Catholic sisters on a 2700-mile bus journey through nine states about the \u2014 to tell Americans about the budget that Congressman Paul Ryan wrote and Governor Romney endorsed. Paul Ryan claims this budget reflects the principles of our shared faith. But the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops stated that the Ryan budget failed a basic moral test because it would harm families living in poverty.\nWe agree with our bishops. And that's why we went on the road, to stand with struggling families and to lift up our Catholic sisters who serve them. Their work to alleviate suffering would be seriously harmed by the Romney-Ryan budget. And that is wrong. \nDuring our \u2014 during our journey, I rediscovered a few truths. First, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are correct when they say that each individual should be responsible. But their budget goes astray in not acknowledging that we are responsible not only for ourselves and our immediate family; rather, our faith strongly affirms that we are all responsible for one another. \nWhile we were in Toledo \u2014 in Toledo, I met 10-year-old twins Matt and Mark in our nation.\nIn Milwaukee I met Billy and his wife and two boys at St. Benedict's dining room. Billy's work hours were cut back in the recession. And Billy is taking responsibility for himself and his family, but right now, without food stamps, he and his wife could not put food on the \u2014 their family table.\nWe share responsibly for creating an economy where parents with jobs earn enough to care for their families. \nIn Cincinnati \u2014 in Cincinnati I met Ginny \nThe Affordable Care Act will cover people like Margaret \nI have so many other stories to tell, but I'll only tell you one more.\nIn Hershey, Pennsylvania, a woman in her late 30s came to me, approached us. She asked for the names of some people she could talk to because she felt alone and isolated. Her neighbors have been polarized by politics masquerading as values. She cares about the well-being of her people in her community. She wishes the rest of the nation would listen to one another with kindness and compassion, listen to one another rather than yell at each other. I told her then, and I tell her now, that she is not alone.\nLooking out at you tonight, I feel your presence, combined with that of the thousands of caring people we met on our journey. Together, we understand an immoral budget that hurts already struggling families does not reflect the \u2014 our nation's values. We are better than that.\nSo I urge you \u2014 So join us. Join us as we Nuns on the Bus, all of us, drive for faith, family and fairness.\nThank you so much. ", "As many of you know, we had a challenging summer in Colorado. Wildfires that devastated homes and businesses, took livelihoods and lives. Then, a few weeks later, terrible shootings in a darkened theater. So on behalf of everyone in Colorado, let me start tonight by saying thank you.\nThank you \u2014 thank you for your thoughts and your prayers, thank you for your generosity to families who lost so much.\nThe president came to Colorado. He walked the charred landscape, met with firefighters and also with those who lost homes or businesses. He and Michelle visited hospitals to comfort families of loved ones killed and injured. They shared in our grief and brought a message of support on behalf of the entire country. We weren't Democrats or Republicans in that moment. We were simply Americans trying to help one another. \nThese tragedies remind us not to waste time bickering. We have the power to come together, and we need to do this as a nation. It will take a spirit of generosity and collaboration to meet the difficult challenges that we face.\nWe recognize this in Colorado, where we've been able to pass vital legislation with strong bipartisan majorities. We don't always agree, but when push comes to shove, Colorado's elected leaders cooperate for the good of our state.\nAnd consequently, we are moving forward. And we need to keep moving forward with President Obama. \nThe president's policies are helping. He set a goal of doubling exports in five years, and so far they are up by almost 40 percent. In Colorado, agricultural exports jumped 59 percent. \nYes, Colorado \u2014Now, we've still got a lot of ground to cover as a country, but we are coming back, not as fast as we want or need, but unlike four years ago, we are finally moving in the right direction.\nNow, I know it's hard right now for a lot of people, and I've been there. Like too many Americans today, I was laid off and out of work for two years during the last really bad recession in 1986. So we started a brewpub. We were turned down by 32 banks and scores of investors. My own mother wouldn't invest. But we got there because like so many other things, our business was not just me; it was we.\nAll right? \nIn Colorado, we know that Western history is not just about rugged individuals. It's about communities coming together to raise barns and build schools and, yes, to help one another. \nColorado and the United States are places that will be defined more by their future than by their past. The president knows this. He knows that to move this country forward, it takes we and not me. \nMy mother, the lone Democrat in a family of Republicans, was widowed twice and raised four kids on her own. She always used to say: You can't always control what life gives you, but you can control how you respond. President Obama inherited many crises, among the worst any president has faced, and in every case he has responded with optimism, with compassion, with courage. \nHe provided hope \u2014 he provided hope when there was none, and he has transformed that hope into a plan rooted in reality. And it takes \u2014 it takes hard work. It takes time. But it's working.\nHe understands that America is indeed a collection of talented, self-motivated individuals competing in a marketplace, but it's more than that.\nIt's also a community that believes in the common good. As another skinny Democrat with a funny last name, I was proud to host the convention in Denver that nominated Barack Obama four years ago. And I am proud to support his re-election. I ask that you join me \u2014 well, we \u2014 in moving Colorado and America forward. We need to finish what we started. Thank you and God bless you.", "Aloha to the Hawaii delegation. \nMy name is Ric Shinseki, and I'm a soldier. I spent 38 years in uniform, and as a veteran, I'm here to speak about a president whose devotion to veterans is sincere, it is steadfast, it is strong. I know this firsthand. I first met Barack Obama in November, 2008. I soon realized we were both shaped and inspired by family members who had served in World War II. Three of my uncles helped liberate Europe.\nWhen they returned home, they helped to raise me. They used the original GI Bill to open small businesses. They worked hard, played by the rules and loved this country. I learned those values from them. And President Obama learned the same values from the veterans in his family.\nDuring our first meeting nearly four years ago, the president's commitment to veterans was clear. He understands that we have the finest military in the world, and we have a commitment to keep our faith with our men and women in uniform. Today our Iraq and Afghanistan warriors have displayed enormous discipline and love of country. \nPresident Obama gets it. He listens. He wants the facts. And the results of his leadership are clear. Since President Obama took office, nearly 800,000 veterans, including a growing population of women veterans, have gained access to VA health care. There's been a historic expansion of treatment for PTSD and traumatic brain injury.\nPresident Obama has expanded job training to prepare veterans for the jobs of the future. And we're on track to end veterans' homelessness by 2015. \nNo president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has done more for veterans. We could not ask for a stronger advocate. We've made tremendous progress under this president's leadership, but there is much more to be done for the men and women who guarantee our way of life. They have served selflessly with unmatched valor, sacrifice and distinction. And President Obama is determined that we will repay our debt to them. \nGod bless our veterans. ", "Good evening. My name's Ed Meagher.\nCan you imagine how it feels to return from war emotionally, psychologically and physically mangled, and the country you've been fighting for does not welcome you home? As a veteran of the Vietnam War, I know exactly how that feels. Nine years ago I decided I would do what I can to give the soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan a better welcome home than I had.\nAlong with two of my fellow Vietnam vets, I work with some of our most seriously injured warriors and their families to prepare them for jobs, to help them find their way through the medical system and to lift their spirits. Alive Days help amputees to realize that even though they've lost limbs, they have their lives. Operation Jump- Start helps them strategically think about the next phase of their lives. We help punch up resumes to reflect skills they possess that they don't know were marketable. We've coached them and provided fresh business outfits and computers to help them with job searches.\nSupporting our effort is President Obama's actions, increasing the VA budget to $140 billion in 2013 \u2014 \u2014 fully funding the new GI Bill, allowing over 800,000 veterans and their families to pursue an education and begin their post-military service to our country.The Obama administration has hired more than 3,500 mental health professionals, and they will hire 1,600 more over the next year to help veterans to cope with post-traumatic stress, traumatic brain injuries, and to strengthen suicide prevention efforts. \nLast Memorial Day, President Obama declared the treatment of Vietnam veterans a national shame. And he spoke two sweet words my generation of returning veterans have yearned to hear: Welcome home. ", "Good evening. Good evening. On behalf of the millions of mothers, daughters, wives, sisters and friends, Republicans and Democrats, who have counted on Planned Parenthood for health care and in honor of the thousands of doctors and staff at Planned Parenthood health centers all across America, I am proud tonight to support the re-election of President Barack Obama.\n\nTwo years ago, when Paul Ryan and John Boehner and Todd Akin and the Tea Party took over the House of Representatives, they promised us they were going to create jobs and jump-start the economy. But instead, on day one, they came after women's health, and they haven't let up since. Right? So first, they voted to end cancer screenings and well women visits for 5 million women. They voted to end funding for birth control with Planned Parenthood. And for good measure, they even tried to redefine rape. \nAnd now Mitt Romney is campaigning to get rid of Planned Parenthood and overturn Roe vs. Wade. \nThis past year, women learned that when we aren't at the table, we're on the menu. \nNearly 100 years ago, when Planned Parenthood was founded, birth control was illegal. And as a result, few women had the opportunity to finish school, and we really weren't even expected to live much past the age of 50. But times have changed. Today we are mothers, and we are teachers and scientists and accountants and members of the armed forces. And because of President Barack Obama, more women than ever are serving in the U.S. Cabinet and on the United States Supreme Court.\nWe've come so far. We've come so far. So why are we having to fight in 2012 against politicians who went to end access to birth control? It's like we woke up on a bad episode of \"Mad Men\" \u2014 \nSo Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan are campaigning for women's votes by saying that women need their help.\nOK, this is coming from two men who are committed to ending insurance coverage for birth control, who would turn women's health care decisions over to our bosses, and who won't even stand up for equal pay for women.\nOK. Well, as my grandmother back in Texas would have said, any more help from Mitt Romney, and I'm going to have to take in ironing. But here's the good news. We already have a president who's on our side. President Obama \u2014 \nPresident Obama ensured that women's preventive care, including birth control too, will be covered by all health care plans with no co-pay, no matter where we work. \nAnd because of President Obama, soon women won't be denied insurance coverage because we've had breast cancer or survived sexual assault. And we're no longer going to pay more than men for the exact same health insurance. \nThanks to President Obama, being a woman is no longer a pre- existing condition in America. That's right. That's right.\nYou know, back in Texas \u2014 . Yay, Texas.\nBack in Texas, we'd say that you dance with them what brung you, OK? Well, President Obama brought women to this dance, and we're staying with him all the way through November. \nTwenty-four years ago, my mother, former Texas governor Ann Richards \u2014 She reminded us \u2014 she reminded us how far we've come and that there was a time when folks had to drink from separate water fountains, when kids were punished for speaking Spanish in the school, when her grandmother couldn't even vote.\nMy mom spent her entire life working to make things more fair. \nWell, just a couple of years before she passed, mom had the chance to become friends with a young senator named Barack Obama. Thank you. Thank you.", "Nine weeks ago today, on the Fourth of July, my daughter Ruby was born. Ruby is a perfect, healthy little girl. And because I have endometriosis, I feel particularly lucky to have her.\nWhen I was 18, I began experiencing severe pelvic and abdominal pain. I went to so many doctors, but nobody had any answers. Several doctors outright dismissed me, treating my pain as the product of a dumb kid's dramatic imagination.\nFinally, I went to Planned Parenthood. They listened to me as no one else has.\nThey answered my questions. A caring nurse practitioner told me she thought I had endometriosis. She connected me with an excellent, respectful surgeon who removed the excess endometrial growth in my pelvis and finally I got better. \nTwelve years later, I am still so grateful for the excellent, affordable, respectful care I received from Planned Parenthood. \nWhen Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan make threats about getting rid of Planned Parenthood funding, it is clear that they have not given a thought to women like me \u2014 women with limited resources who are sick and scared. They haven't thought about planned and wanted babies like Ruby who are able to be here only because their mothers received the health care they needed. \nPresident Obama understands and he cares. And that's why I'm here. I'm here tonight for my daughter \u2014 to stand up for her so that when she grows up, Planned Parenthood will be there for her too. ", "Thank you.\nMy fellow Democrats, I want to welcome you all to North Carolina \u2014 \u2014 and tell you a story about our state. You've seen the skyscrapers and all that Charlotte has to offer. Maybe you've heard about our Research Triangle Park. Maybe your children attended one of our great universities. We're proud of all that because we made that possible in North Carolina. And let me tell you how.\nFifty years ago this was a poor state, poor, rural and rigidly segregated. But we had a governor named Terry Sanford, a hero of mine. He worked with business leaders, political and education leaders to build our great universities, our 58 community colleges and our public schools.\nThe result? Our high-tech, thriving economy that you see today. Together, we in North Carolina did that, and we're proud of it.\nTwenty years ago \u2014 20 years ago I ran for a third term as governor. I'd retired from politics, but I came back because I knew that economic growth and good jobs depend on a good education. And I wanted \u2014 I wanted to make sure that a good education was available to every child in this state.\nWe did extraordinary things in the next eight years. We built one of the best early childhood education programs in America called Smart Start. \nTeachers have the hardest and most important job in America. \nSo let me tell you what's happened here. Last year, students born nearly 20 years ago in 1993, finished high school with the highest graduation rate in our history.\nThey'd gone through Smart Start. They'd had great teachers. And companies want to come here to North Carolina to hire them. That's what we did in North Carolina. \nWe are doers in this state. We build for the future. We want leaders who are doers. And in Barack Obama, we have a great education president who is rebuilding America. His Race to the Top program is doing more to spur us to improve our public schools than anything we've ever done as a nation.\nIn the depth of the near-depression that he faced when he came in, Barack Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress provided recovery funds that literally kept our classrooms open. Two years ago \u2014 two years ago these funds saved nearly 20,000 teacher and education jobs just here in North Carolina. \nHe has a huge focus on improving early childhood education so that every child starts to school healthy and ready to learn \u2014 I like to say, ready to fly. He's doubled funding for Pell Grants. He beat back forces in Congress that wanted to double interest rates on college loans.\nHe's investing $115 million new dollars in historically black colleges and universities just here in North Carolina. \nPresident Barack Obama is a doer. And we in America will do big things with him. \nNow, the other crowd doesn't get it. They say just cut taxes for the wealthiest, get rid of regulations, and job growth \u2014 job growth will happen like magic. Folks, magic didn't do it in North Carolina. This is not a time for America to believe in Magic.This is a time to drive education forward. This is a time to drive the economy forward. This is a time to drive America forward. We must do it together, and we must re-elect Barack Obama as president of the United States. \nThank you, and let's work our hands off. ", "My name is Johanny Adames, and I'm very excited to be here. But not nearly as excited as my mom Aloa \nMy mom taught me to work hard. Today, I'm a student at Miami- Dade College, working hard toward my degree. This could only happen in America. But it only happened for me because of a Pell Grant. \nPresident Obama knows that education is how kids like me can follow a path \u2014 opportunity and work their way into the middle class. He fought to expand the Pell Grants so nearly 10 million young Americans can have that opportunity.\nEven better, he doubled the of Pell Grants so that someone like me can afford tuition and pay for books too.\nWhen you're trying to pay for college, every dollar makes a difference. And President Obama has made a huge difference for us. Everybody says that young people like me are America's future. But Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan want to cut the Pell Grants that made my future possible. If they don't invest in my future, do they really believe in America?I was proud to get my U.S. citizenship this year. And on November 6th, I'll be proud to cast my first vote. I want a president who believes in me, and my mom is not running this year. But President Obama believes in every kid, no matter who they are or where they come from. He doesn't just believe in my future. He's building America's future. And I can't wait to vote for him.\nThank you. ", "I'm here tonight as a parent with two young children who attend a wonderful public school. And no one \u2014 no one has more at stake in this election than our nation's children, and that's why collectively we need to re-elect President Obama. President Obama knows education is about jobs. It's about giving every child a shot at a secure middle-class life. And right now, we're in a race for jobs and industries of the future. If countries like China outeducate us today, they will outcompete us tomorrow.\nThe president knows that education begins at home, with parents who step up and take responsibility. But he also believes that teachers matter. In his first two years of office, he helped save the jobs of 400,000 educators. \nAnd the president didn't just invest resources, he demanded reform. And 46 states responded courageously by raising education standards. The president also believes that teachers must be respected and paid like the true professionals they are.\nNo teacher should have to teach to the test, and great teachers must be recognized and rewarded.\nPresident Obama also knows that higher education is an economic necessity. He fought to keep student loan interest rates from going up. He fought for Pell Grants. He took the big banks out of the federal student loan program and passed the billions of dollars in savings on to our nation's young people. \nThe president knows that the path to the middle class goes right through America's classrooms. That was his path, and that's America's path. However, his opponent believes very differently. Under the Romney-Ryan budget, education would be cut, cut by as much as 20 percent. Now, take a minute and think about what that would really mean: 200,000 fewer children in Head Start, fewer teachers in the classroom, fewer resources for poor kids and students with disabilities, fewer after-school programs, and 10 million students could see their Pell Grants reduced, putting higher education further out of reach.\nAnd these cuts wouldn't somehow create jobs or pay down the deficit. Instead, they would go towards a huge new tax cut for those at the very top. In order to cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires, Governor Romney will cut education for our nation's children. That's the choice. That's the choice in this election.\nThey see education as an expense. President Obama sees it as an investment. And that's why our president needs four more years. \nThank you so much, and God bless. Thank you.", "Good evening. I'm Senator Barb Mikulski from the great state of Maryland. \nTwenty-six years ago I became the first Democratic woman elected to the Senate in her own right. I was the first, but I made sure I wasn't the only. Today we're proud that there are more women serving in the United States Senate right this minute than had served in all of American history when I arrive.\nBut we want more. \nNow, we Democratic women of the Senate are like the Olympic team. As you can see, we come in different sizes \u2014 \nWe build families, businesses and communities. We're Sunday School teachers and former governors; prosecutors and moms in tennis shoes. I was a \u2014 \nFriends, we work on macro issues and we work on the macaroni and cheese issues. \nThese are our priorities. These are President Obama's priorities. We know that every issue is a woman's issue. \nAnd equal pay for equal work is an all-American issue. The 77 cents that women make for every dollar men earn makes a real difference to our families \u2014 families stretching to make every dollar count.\nWe are so proud that the first law signed by President Barack Obama was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. \nNothing has done more \u2014 nothing has done more to improve the day-to-day lives of American women and our families than health care reform. Before health care reform, women \u2014 can you believe this \u2014 women would be charged 50 percent more for their health insurance than men. In nine states \u2014 \u2014 listen to this, in nine states victims of domestic violence were denied coverage simply because of those victims.\nWell, anyway, you know what was happening. We \u2014 our mammograms and our cancer test straining the family budgets. Often we had to go without to be able to pay for those services. And we've tried to change that. Millions of American families know that we're just one medical catastrophe away from financial disaster.\nNow, we Democrats believe in family responsibility, not family bankruptcy. \nWith health care reform, we're making gender discrimination by those insurance companies illegal. We ensured lifesaving preventive services and the full range of reproductive services are now covered. \nWe, the Democratic women of the Senate, have worked with our president to do a lot to strengthen families and restore security in the middle class. And like the first family, we stand with our military families. \nNow we are ready to do more. And for that, we need reinforcements. Take a look at the women running this year, those who can help us and the president get the job done for you. \nGod bless you, and God bless America. ", "Good evening, fellow Democrats, especially those from Iowa. \nYou know, rural Americans are a special people. Their labor puts food on our table and fuel in our gas tanks.\nTheir service in our military sets a powerful example of leadership, honor and sacrifice. Their spirit of community inspires us all.\nPresident Obama's fight for rural America is personal. He was raised by a single mom and grandparents from Kansas. He hails from a farming state, Illinois. He understand the challenges that rural communities and families face protecting their middle class way of life, preserving their heartland values.\nLast week, we heard folks at the other convention say they wanted to take our country back. But here's what I noticed, they didn't say back to what. Well, we know what backwards looks like. We know what happened to middle-class families after two tax cuts for people who didn't need them, after deregulation of banking and housing sectors and the historic recession that followed. And we know how far we've come.\nToday President Obama is helping farmers sell their products in new markets here and abroad, spurring economic opportunity and development in rural areas. Today President Obama is infusing new capital into rural communities, providing a record number of loans to farmers and small business owners, revitalizing aging infrastructure and boosting job creation.\nAnd today President Obama is making smart investments in clean energy, in wind, solar and biofuels \u2014 all as part of an all-of-the- above energy strategy that supports thousands of jobs \u2014 not in the Middle East, but in the Midwest of our great country. \nAnd in this season of severe drought, President Obama has acted to help while calling on Congress to act as well because he understands that in tough times, Americans pull together.\nFrom here, we have more to do, much more. And President Obama has a detailed plan for a new rural economy \u2014 more support for small businesses making, creating and innovating; more investment in the production of biofuels and other biomaterials; and more trade and more markets.\nRural Americans want leaders who help the middle-class communities to plant and prosper over the long term, not opportunists who reap the rewards for themselves, leaving nothing for the people who do the sowing. They deserve leaders who appreciate their contributions, who believe in their potential and who care enough to invest in their communities and their families. And that's what they have, ladies and gentlemen, in President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. \nNow, last week we heard from the party that wants to take the country back. Well, in America's heartland, we're voting for President Obama, the president who will keep our country and rural America moving forward.\nGod bless you. ", "Good evening. Good evening. Good evening, fellow Democrats. \nI stand before you as the first mother and first grandmother to serve as Democratic leader and first speaker of the House of Representatives. \nDemocrats believe in reigniting the American dream by removing barriers to success and building ladders of opportunity for all so that everyone can succeed. Jobs are central to the American dream, and President Obama has focused on jobs from day one. \nThe American dream is about freedom. Jobs means freedom for workers to support their families. Working with President Obama, Democrats passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to strengthen the rights of women in the workplace. \nWe repealed \"don't ask, don't tell\" so our troops can serve the country they love regardless of whom they love. \nWe made college more affordable. House Democrats passed the DREAM Act \u2014 \nWith President Obama, Democrats enacted the toughest consumer safeguards in history to protect Main Street from recklessness of some on Wall Street. \nWe \u2014 Democrats passed health care reform to allow Americans the freedom to pursue their passions, to make health care a right, not a privilege and to ensure that being a woman is no longer a pre-existing medical condition. \nOur freedom is ensured every day by our men and women in uniform. We must build a future worthy of their sacrifice. We thank them for keeping America the land of the free and the home of the brave. \nThis year we are determined to re-elect an extraordinary president who in no ordinary time led America back from the brink of depression while Republicans tried to block him at every turn. This election offers the clearest choice of our time. Many names are on the ballot. So, too, on the ballot is the character of our country. Why is that? Medicare is on the ballot.\nDemocrats will preserve and strengthen Medicare. Republicans will end the Medicare guarantee. It's just plain wrong.\nWhen you go to the vote \u2014 polls, vote for Medicare. Vote for President Obama. \nSocial Security is on the ballot. Democrats enacted it; Democrats will fight to preserve it. Some Republicans want to replace the guarantee of Social Security with a gamble of private accounts. It's just plain wrong. When you go to the polls, vote for Social Security. Vote for President Barack Obama. \nAnd the hard-fought rights of women are on the ballot. Democrats trust the judgment of women. We reject the Republican assault on women's reproductive health. It's just plain wrong.When you go to the polls, vote for women's rights. Vote for President Obama. \nAnd our democracy is on the ballot. Democrats believe we must curb the influence of special interests on our political institutions. Democrats believe we must create jobs, not protect the special interests. We must build the economy from the middle out, not the top down. To change policy for the middle class, we must change politics. Democrats will work to overturn Citizens United \u2014 \u2014 while Republicans support opening the floodgates to special interest money and suppressing the right to vote.\nIt's just plain wrong.We believe in the government of the many, not the privileged few. When you go to the polls, vote for democracy. Vote for President Barack Obama. \nAnd the American dream is on the ballot. We have work to do to reignite the American dream, to build ladders of opportunity for our middle class and remove barriers to success. When you go to the polls, vote for the American dream. Vote for strong Democratic majorities in the United States Senate, in the House of Representatives. Vote for Vice President Joe Biden and President Barack Obama. \nGod bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you all very much. ", "Wow. It looks great from up here. And it is such an honor to be here tonight, all the way from big sky country. I am proud to be here as a Montanan, as an educator, as a Democrat and as a member of the Mandan and Hidatsa tribes.\n\nMy parents told me that education was the path to success. And they showed me by taking me to Head Start in Billings, Montana, while they were pursuing their own college degrees. My mom is here tonight, Carol Juneau, as a Montana delegate. Thank you for all of your support. \nEssential to my success were the teachers who invested their time and talent in me so I could go from high school on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation to Montana State University \u2014 go Cats \u2014 to Harvard Graduate School, and finally, law school at the University of Montana \u2014 go Grizz. \nTeachers do the noble work of educating our children. Teachers do the work that matters. And we cannot thank them enough for the hard work they put in every day to ensure a bright future for all of us. \nAs a teacher, I was an advocate for my students and their success. Now, as superintendent of public instruction in Montana, I have the honor to be the top advocate for the education of all of our state's children. As Democrats \u2014 as Democrats, we believe that every child, regardless of background or ability, is entitled to an excellent education.\nOur determination to strengthen our schools, provide a 21st-century education for every child, compels us to work to re-elect President Barack Obama. \nOur commitment to create jobs for the American people and to grow our economy from the middle out drives our determination to re-elect the president.\nPresident Obama knows that education is the best investment an individual can make in themselves, that a family can make in its children and that a nation can make in its people. That's why he made historic investments in higher education, making college more affordable from community colleges to Pell Grant scholarships and student loans. \nPresident Obama knows that the value of education is not just in the equations our students memorize or the books they read. For some students, school is the only place where they get a hot meal and a warm hug. \nTeachers are sometimes the only ones who tell our children they can go from an Indian reservation to the Ivy League; from the home of a struggling single mom to the White House. Our schools are where we pass down our stories and our history. And in my family, that American history goes back centuries, back to the first residents \u2014 Native Americans. \nPresident Obama understands that the Native American story includes both painful chapters and hopeful ones. He knows that the Native American story is part of America's story, and that we deserve to be part of the American dream.\n\nThat's why he welcomed the tribal nations to the White House and joined them at the table. He signed the Cobell Settlement to correct the long-standing injustice \u2014 When he brought health care to all Americans, he helped build hospitals, train nurses and ensure healthy moms and healthy babies in tribal communities.\nIt was a proud day in Montana when President Obama visited the Crow Nation and became an adopted Crow tribal member. \nThank you very much.", "Good evening, brothers and sisters. And I'm a third-generation coal miner from Nemacolin, Pennsylvania.\nAnd I'm here on behalf of millions of people who do the work of America.\nRemember last week Mitt Romney told us that he and his friends built America without any help from the rest of us. You see, we're the ones who build America. We're the ones who build it every single day because it's our work that connects us.\nSo I want you to look around this convention at all the hardworking men and women who make this place run, the ones keeping us safe, serving our food, driving our buses and cleaning up after the party's over. \nSo we know that every worker here in Carolina \u2014 North Carolina, just like every other state in this country and every country in the world, deserves the right to organize and to bargain collectively. And the Democratic platform, unlike its counterpart in Tampa, makes crystal clear that Barack Obama and the Democratic Party will fight to protect and strengthen this fundamental human right.\n\nIn the 21st century global economy, prosperity requires leaders committed to creating good jobs by investing in our future: in our ports, roads, bridges, airports; in energy and telecommunications; and in our public schools. \nAnd we know that the wealthiest and most powerful among us, those who have benefitted most in recent years, must do their part to help rebuild America. See, prosperity requires economic security. And we will stand with leaders who strengthen and protect Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid, not those who plan to cut benefits the working people paid for, earned and are counting on. \nProsperity requires democracy, starting with the essential right of everyone in this great country to a voice, both at the ballot box and at the workplace \u2014 \u2014 the right to solve problems together and to climb the ladder to the middle class the old-fashioned way: through hard work fairly rewarded.\nNow, President Obama and Vice President Biden have put the country on the right path towards jobs and shared prosperity, despite the obstruction they faced from a dishonest, politically motivated, economically challenged republic ", "Good evening, everyone. Good evening, Connecticut, and thank you very much. \nIn politics, you don't want to follow the person who sings the Star-Spangled Banner or a great icon like that. That was a wonderful, wonderful speech. God bless him. \nBut I'm here to talk about America's choice in this election. So let me get right to the point. Mitt Romney has said that if he was president and Paul Ryan's budget passed, he would sign it into law. That's what he said. So let's talk about what it would mean.\nMedicare would become a voucher program, effectively ending the guarantee of health coverage for millions of senior citizens. \nMedicaid would be slashed, jeopardizing coverage for millions of children, people with disabilities and family members in long-term care.\nEducation would be slashed 20 percent, from Head Start through college and everywhere in between. \nAnd all of these cuts, all of these cuts are being done so Romney can give a tax cut of $265,000 to your average millionaire.\nAnd he would continue \u2014 \nWe Democrats have nothing against people who've earned their wealth. We salute their hard work and their good fortune. But slashing what we invest in schools, in roads, in research, in development, in clean energy and in the things that protect our most vulnerable just to cut taxes for those at the top is ridiculous. It's wrong. But that's the Romney-Ryan budget. It isn't conservative. It's harsh. It's radical. And it is wrong. \nLet's be clear. Let's be clear: It would shred the safety net that protects the middle class and those striving to be in the middle class. It would undermine FDR's New Deal, unravel Harry Truman's Fair Deal and leave us with Mitt Romney's raw deal. \nPresident Obama and we Democratic governors believe something very different. We believe that a budget is more than just a bunch of numbers; it is a document that reflects our values. We believe we can and should make government leaner, cheaper and more effective, cutting waste and trimming fat where we can. That's why President Obama signed into law 2 trillion in spending cuts, bringing annual domestic spending to its lowest level as a share of the economy since President Eisenhower.\nBut we can \u2014 but we can and should ask every American to shoulder their fair share, not just the squeezed middle class but also those at the very top, who have done so very, very well these past few years.\nWe can and should invest in what will strengthen and grow the middle class: good schools, affordable health care, medical research, clean energy, modern roads and high-speed trains. That's what President Obama believes, that's what Democratic governors believe and that's what we've done in state after state after state. \nSo let's talk about jobs. President Obama has helped create 4.5 million private-sector jobs in our country since he took office. Mitt Romney says he'll create jobs, but in what country where he has money on deposit will that actually be done?\nIn Connecticut \u2014 well, let's look at some other issues. Let's look at voting rights. In Connecticut, we're expanding them and making it easier for people to register to vote and to vote. The Republican governors \u2014 the Republican governors, in states that they control, have taken 19 states. They've engaged in a systemic effort to disenfranchise millions of African-Americans, Hispanics and senior citizens as they \u2014 as they try to undermine the fairness of this election.\nNow let's talk about women's rights. And this is personal. My wife ran a rape crisis center for 11 years. Put it this way \u2014 that's why there are three reasons that everyone should vote for Barack Obama over Mitt Romney: your sister, your mother and your daughter.\nLet's stand for them. Let's stand for the women of America.\nAs Democrats \u2014 as Democrats, we have a deep and abiding belief \u2014 a belief that America is full of people from all walks of life, people who are good and decent and work hard, people who are respectful to others and who do not discriminate based on gender, on age, on race, on religion on ethnicity, on disability or sexual orientation. \nWe need to fight for our children, fight for our senior citizens, fight for women's rights, fight for the middle class and fight for our country's future. That's why we need to fight for Barack Obama. ", "Hello, California. California is in the house. \nI stand before you today \u2014 I stand before you today as a proud member of the Congressional Black Caucus and former speaker of the California State Assembly. \nForty-seven years ago, in the face of opposition from those who said states should have the right to discriminate, America passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. People of all races, religions and backgrounds joined together and fought for that law because every one of us deserves a fair shake and a fair chance at achieving our version of the American dream. The right to vote gives us the power to take our future into our own hands. We must use that power today so that we do not lose it tomorrow.\nToday one of the darkest shadows of the past century is creeping into this one. One of our most basic rights, the right to vote, a right that we fought for and won, is under attack. Throughout the union, governors and legislators have proposed or passed laws to make it more difficult for individuals to cast their ballots. We must build and be part of a nation where justice isn't just a catchphrase but embodies the equality and fairness that our nation's founders envisioned. \nMore than 41 years ago when the Congressional Black Caucus was founded, that was our charge, and it still is \u2014 \u2014 a vote and a voice in choosing our leaders, passing our laws and setting the course for our nation. And for the future we seek, a generation of greater opportunity for all of us, we stand with President Obama in setting that path that moves us forward.Friends, let me take just one moment to say \u2014 \u2014 I am proud to live in the USA! U-S-A! U-S-A!I am proud, proud to live in this great country.\nBut friends, I must tell you: America, it is up to us right now. It is up to us to make the decision on the type of country we will have. Either we will move forward towards securing economic future to be built to last, with a strong middle class, or we will go back to a place where America's promise is only fulfilled for a select few. America, this we will not do! \nIn the '60s we marched because it was the right thing for our country. And it made us stronger. Fortified by our faiths and endowed by our creator, we helped our country to overcome obstacles once thought insurmountable. In our nation's laws, they were thought to be insurmountable. In our hearts, we thought they were insurmountable.\nAnd once again, it's our time to uphold justice. It's our time to protect the rights that we have won. And it's our time to stand up for the country we love, the United States of America. \nOur faith tells us we have a moral obligation to better our community, to accept responsibility and to care for each other. But these values are not just unique to believers. They are American values, and this is the American way.\nAmerica, it is up to us. It's up to us to wake up. It's up to us to sit up. It's up to us to stand up. It's up to us to get up. It's up to us to show up at the polls and re-elect the honorable Barack Obama president of the United States of America. U-S-A! U-S-A!America, I'm a strong believer that how we treat each other matters. As public servants, it's our job to work in the spirit of comity to move this nation forward. But we also need all of you working with us to assure America's strong future.\nTonight, I cannot speak to you without acknowledging that the bickering and brinksmanship we see too often in our politics is advantaging no political party.\nIt weakens our nation. We can be fervent in our disagreements without being factitious with our beliefs. We can be tough without being toxic.\nTo my colleagues in Congress, we will never be better off without being better. \nIn my 5th Congressional District of Missouri \u2014 \u2014 Republicans and Democrats tell me that they would like to look at their political leaders and see more warm hearts and fewer hot heads, more facts and fewer falsehoods. Many of us want the same thing.\nNow, I greatly respect my Republican colleagues and their ideas. But make no mistake: I am proud to be a Democrat. I am proud to be a member of this great party.\nAnd we have, in many instances, been hit. You know, they are a liberal, they are progressive. Look, if being liberal and progressive means that I care for children and whether they go hungry, color me liberal.\nColor me \u2014 And don't you ever forget it.We are the party that is deeply committed to diversity. We consider every individual a valuable asset to our democracy. This is a great nation. We may be a nation of Democrats, independents and Republicans, but first and foremost we are all human beings and Americans. \nThere is something essential in the human spirit that always searches for hope. We are driven by hope. President Barack Obama has been lampooned for speaking of hope \u2014 hope for a better America. I want to encourage our president and all of us to continue to hope for an America that remembers, recognizes and fervently protects its greatness.\nYes, Mr. President, hope on. \nWe are people of \u2014 Mr. President, hope on! Hope on! \nMr. President \u2014 Mr. President, we want you to speak of hope to the American people, because it is impossible for hope to overdraw its account in God's bank. \nHope fills the holes of my frustration in my heart. Hope inspires me to believe that any day now, we will catch up to the ideals put forth by our nation's founding fathers. Hope is the motivation that empowers the unemployed, enabling them to get out of bed every single morning with unbounded enthusiasm as they look for work. It is our hope and faith that moves us to action.\n\nAnd march on \u2014 and march on means marching through our communities to make sure everyone is registered and ready to vote. \nNow, before I sit down, let me erase some confusion. Let me tell you something. There are people who poke fun at us Democrats. They say we go too far with this inclusion stuff. They say that we have a caucus for tall people and a caucus for short people and a caucus for people who don't fit into any other caucus. But let me just tell you God did not burden the United States with a diversity of backgrounds, ideals and religions. He blessed America with them. And as such, we, the United States of America, is best able to demonstrate to the rest of the world what God intended when he created us.\nAnd we, in our diversity and our differences, are all in this together. \nLet me be clear. Let me be clear. I'm not just talking about black people. When I say we, I'm not just talking about people of color. When I say we, I'm not just talking about Democrats. When I say we, I'm not talking about anything except all of America. \nAnd together, we must move the United States of America forward. There is more power \u2014 more power in \u2014 \nTogether, together, we will heal the country when we live up to our nation's motto: E pluribus unum \u2014 out of many, one. Yes, yes, we are one. We are one. We might be black, brown, yellow. It doesn't matter. We are one.\nWe may be poor, we may be rich, but we are one. We might be up, or we might be down, but we are one. We may be up, we may be down. We are one. ", "Thank you. \nNow, I stand here tonight as a proud son of the great state of New York.\n\nBut Dad's job brought stress. On Sunday nights I'd lay in bed and hear him pacing the floor, restless about returning to work Monday morning. But what drove him were his big hopes for his kids' future. He believed that if you worked hard, played by the rules, you could pass on a better life to your children. Today families like the one I grew up in still believe in that American dream. But as President Obama says, it's a make-or-break moment for the middle class.\nNow, Mitt Romney's plans would make things worse. We've tried trickle-down tax cuts for the wealthy and anything goes for big corporations. We tried it under a president who billed himself as a compassionate conservative. It didn't work, and now we have Mitt Romney calling himself a severe conservative. The last Republican president gave huge tax cuts to millionaires that exploded our deficits. Mitt Romney not only wants to make those tax cuts permanent, he wants to add more tax breaks for the wealthy that would make our deficit even bigger.\nThe last Republican president tried to privatize Social Security. The Romney-Ryan ticket says, why stop with Social Security when you can also privatize Medicare?\n\nThe last Republican president gave us an ultra-conservative Supreme Court. Mitt Romney would move the court even further to the right, putting landmark decisions like Roe v. Wade at risk.\nYou know, some say Romney would repeat the past. I disagree. He'd be worse. \nNow, take taxes. When Mitt Romney says he wants to reform the tax code, hold onto your wallets. We know Mitt Romney never met a tax haven he didn't like. But his new favorite tax haven is not the Cayman Islands. It's Paul Ryan's budget. Under this plan, under the Ryan budget, Mitt Romney's own taxes would drop almost to zero.\nBut for the middle class, the Ryan budget's a rip-off. Families with children whose household income is less than $200,000 would see their taxes go up $2,000 on average. That's not trickle-down \u2014 that's a dirty truck. \nMitt Romney's only bottom line is the one at the end of his own bank statements. What's the problem? The problem is that Mitt Romney confuses his own narrow self-interests and that of people like him with the national interest. He thinks as long as we do right by the Mitt Romneys of the world, America will be just fine.\nWe can't afford a president with so narrow a perspective. We certainly want those at the top to do well, but if you base your entire presidency and your entire economic platform on helping them do even better, you're missing what makes the economy tick.\nBecause not everyone has been as fortunate as Mitt Romney, you cannot base your whole approach on a life experience as rarefied as his. If your focus is only on those like Mitt Romney, it's not going to help the economy or do enough for the middle class. Now, there are so many reasons why Mitt Romney should not become president, but perhaps the most of all is the insidious narrowness of his experience, perspective and vision. \nNow, Barack Obama has different priorities. He knows America does best when the middle class succeeds, not just those at the top. On foreign policy, President Obama has kept our nation safe from terrorism. He's restored our standing in the world. When it comes to one of our closest allies, Israel, President Obama has been resolute. \nThe two biggest threats to Israel are the threat of nuclear weapons from Iran and the launching of Hezbollah rockets from Lebanon. No president in history has done more to confront these threats. The president has imposed the toughest sanctions ever on Iran, and provided record amounts of security to aid Israel. \nRepublicans always try to paint Democrats as weak on defense.\nThis time, they can't. After all, Mitt Romney's idea of an overseas accomplishment is sending U.S. jobs there. \nNow, Barack Obama knows that to create an economy built to last, we need to focus on middle-class families \u2014 families who stay up on Sunday nights pacing the floor, like my dad did, while their children, tucked in bed, dream big dreams; families who aren't sure what Monday morning will bring, but who believe our nation's best days are still ahead. President Obama hasn't stopped fighting for those families, and now we need to fight for him. \nTo those like Mitt Romney who want to take us backward, let us send a strong, strong message in November. As we say in Brooklyn, fugetaboutit. ", "Hello, California, hello, delegates and hello, everyone else in the United States. I'm Tom Steyer. I'm a businessman, a professional investor and a proud Democrat.\nI think Mitt Romney and I share an income bracket, although I guess we're never going to know for sure. But the reason I'm here tonight is that Mitt Romney and I don't share the same vision for the future, especially when it comes to energy. You see, this election is a choice, a choice about whether to go backward or forward. And that choice is especially stark when it comes to energy.\nTake Mitt Romney's approach. Governor Romney would do nothing to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and much to increase it. He would gut President Obama's investments in clean energy. He wants to keep giving 4 billion taxpayer dollars to oil companies every year, the very same companies pouring millions into the outside groups backing his campaign.\nOr we could follow President Obama's long-term plan for the future \u2014 for an economy fueled by a safe, secure, sustainable energy supply. \nDuring the last several years, we've seen tremendous progress on new technologies that can make us energy independent and create thousands of jobs. This is about investing for the long haul, not for a quick and dirty buck. This is about taking control of our destiny by doing what Americans do best: out-innovating, out-hustling and out-thinking our competitors.\nAnd President Obama has put us on track to do just that, making investments for the long term. Last week in Tampa, you didn't hear any plans that would create jobs now or a long-term plan for energy security. You also didn't hear very many facts. So here are a few:\nAmerica's dependence on foreign oil is the lowest in two decades. Even as we've tightened our belts elsewhere, America has made record investments in clean energy technologies, from wind to solar to biofuels. We're modernizing our electrical grid to harness more renewable power sources. We're doubling fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks. And domestic production of natural gas is at an all-time high \u2014 natural gas, which, if developed safely and responsibly, could help bridge our energy present to our energy future.\nBig things are happening. Thanks to President Obama, America is laying the foundation for the way we power tomorrow. \nSo here's my question for you. Should we go back to the boom and bust, \"drill, baby, drill,\" polluting energy policies of yesterday?Or should we embrace an advanced energy economy that meets opportunity with innovation?Should we settle for an economy built on shifting and uncertain sands?Or should we keep building an economy made to last?Governor Romney's road to the future will lead to dirty air and increasing climate volatility, uncertainty over energy prices and less security, not more.\nPresident Obama's road to the future will lead us to energy independence, true energy security, a safer and cleaner environment and countless new jobs that can never be outsourced. \nNow, I say this not as the head of Greenpeace or the Sierra Club. I say it as the head of an investment firm that has spent the last quarter century crunching numbers and making tough calls. President Obama knows that advanced energy is America's future, and my bet as a business man is that he's exactly right. \nYou know, last week we heard a lot about Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan's philosophy, their idea that if government was dismantled into tax breaks and vouchers, if government just got out of their way, then all of our problems would be solved.\nHere's what we believe. We do better together than on our own. Our country succeeds when everyone does their fair share and everyone gets a fair shot.\n\nPresident Obama knows that only by coming together, only by embracing our shared responsibilities can we meet the tough challenges ahead, challenges like mobilizing an advanced energy revolution and creating jobs, like making America an energy leader. So let's embrace a vision of a clean, healthy planet, the one that God gave us, and not a scorched earth that can't sustain future generations. \nAll day long I make decisions about smart investments and risky gambles. So does the president. President Obama is making the smart investments we need, and my vote for him is an investment in jobs today, energy security tomorrow and a stronger country for all of our kids.\nThank you very much, and God bless America. ", "For me, as it is for so many Americans, this election is personal. When I look at the middle-class tradition President Obama is fighting to save, the one Mitt Romney's policies would destroy, I see the very reason I am able to stand here tonight.\nWhen I was a teenager, my father, one of the first soldiers on the beaches of Okinawa, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Our family relied on veterans benefits to help provide his care, and we relied on my mom to provide for all seven of us kids. She had the chance to participate in a worker training program, and she seized the opportunity.\nBut it wasn't easy for us to make it. For a while we were on food stamps. And without federal student loans, my brothers and sisters and I would never have had a shot at a college degree.\nStruggle and sacrifice, relentless perseverance and investment in our children's potential, that's the story of millions of American families. \nMitt Romney and Paul Ryan have a very different vision for our economy and it would mean a very different future for our middle class and everyone working to get into it. To them, every problem is a nail and the only hammer they have is cutting taxes for millionaires and billionaires. \nTheir plan would cut away at the foundation of our great nation. It would mean throwing in the towel on our middle class. And we are not going to let them do it \u2014 \u2014 not with President Obama in the White House and not with the a strong Democratic majority having his back in the Senate.\nWhy is that important? Well, listen to what a Republican Congress would do with a Republican president.\nThey would end Medicare's guaranteed benefits \u2014 \nHe took the reins of our economy when we were losing 800,000 jobs a month and pulled us back from the edge. He brought affordable and acceptable health care to millions of Americans not because it was easy or popular but because it was the right thing to do. He made historic investments in our nation's veterans at a time when they are too often forgotten. He stood shoulder to shoulder against Republican attacks on women's health.\nSo the choice in this election and the charge for our party is clear: Re-elect this president, keep the Senate Democratic, and we can make sure every American family has the opportunities mine did. \nRepublicans may have given up on our country's middle class, but President Obama never has, Senate Democrats never have, and together, we never will. Thank you so much. Thank you.", "Thank you very much.\nA few months ago I received a letter from an Arizona man. Tucked into an envelope, faded and folded, was a war bond. At the top were these words: \"Purchased on the island of Guam\" \u2014 \u2014 \"30 June 1945.\"\nNearly 70 years ago, while war raged across the globe, his father bought that bond. He placed his bet on America, and now his son donated it to elect a Democratic majority in the United States Congress. \nHe knew what many Americans know today: the dream that war bond was intended to protect is at risk. Well, let me tell you something: House Democrats and President Obama will bet on America's middle class. We will protect that dream.\nThat's the choice in this election.\nRemember who we fought for with the Democratic majority in the House and President Obama in the White House. At the start we sent the president the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act \u2014 \nFirst responders at Ground Zero in my home state finally got the health care they deserve. Paul Ryan and 160 Republicans, they voted no. \nWe expanded veterans' health care. We cut middle-class taxes. We protected consumers from credit card company abuses. And today no parent has to worry that their children won't have health care because of a pre-existing condition. \nBut that's not what America is getting from these Romney-Ryan Republicans. Instead of fighting for middle-class jobs here at home, they fought for tax breaks for big corporations sending jobs overseas. Instead of protecting consumers from health insurance abuses, they tried 33 times to repeal those protections even as they kept congressional health care for themselves. Instead of reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, they try to redefine rape. Instead of standing up for small businesses, they spent all of their time trying to shut down Planned Parenthood.\nAnd Mitt Romney, he sure liked what he saw.\nHe picked the architect of this assault on the middle class to be his running mate.\nPaul Ryan wrote the budget that turns Medicare into voucher care and could charge seniors $6,400 more every year, while funding tax breaks for millionaires. \nHere's their economic plan, ladies and gentlemen. If you're a millionaire, you win the lottery. If you're a senior, you lose your Medicare guarantee.\nThey have had two years to put the middle class first. Time is up. Folks, we're not going to convince them. We're going to have to replace them. And let me tell you how we're going to do it. We're going to do it with Democratic candidates who are problem solvers. They're small-business owners who created jobs. Mayors who balanced budgets. Police chiefs who lowered crime. Veterans who defended our nation. Even an astronaut.\nThey'll put the middle class first because they share those values that drive our party and our president. They're the values I grew up with on Long Island. Before World War II, my community was mostly potato peels and pumpkin farms. Faced with war, that generation turned farmland into factories and became the backbone of America's middle class. They crossed oceans, stormed beaches, liberated Europe, raced to the Pacific, won the war. And when they got home, they looked at the moon across the vast expanse of space and said, we can go there too. And they went. \nGiven the chance, nothing can stop America's middle class except the wrong priorities. That's what this election is about.\nDemocrats are fighting for an economy that is built to last, an economy where prosperity comes not from the top down but from the middle class out. That war bond from Guam, it was a bet on America's future and we won. Now it's important to America's future that we win again. And ladies and gentlemen, in 62 days we will win.\nGod bless America. ", "Good evening. Buenas noches. \nThere are 50 million Hispanics living in the United States. And today, we have a president who's made sure we have a seat at the table. Today, we have to stand up, speak up and fight for what is right. The choice we confront could not be clearer. We can move forward with the president or backward with his opponents.\nPresident Obama understands that our economy prospers when it is built from the middle out, not the top down, and when every American has the opportunity to join the middle class. That's why \u2014 \u2014 that's why he has a plan to keep creating jobs, invest in our future and reduce the deficit in a balanced way. His opponents would trade everything that keeps the middle class strong just so they can cut taxes for the wealthy. Well, that's not fair, and it makes no sense.\nPresident Obama also understands the obligation we owe our most vulnerable citizens. His opponents might pay lip service to that principle, but their policies would devastate the programs so many American families depend on.\nSo there's a choice in this election between two divergent paths for this country and two fundamentally different sets of values. The president is a champion of comprehensive immigration reform and is preventing the deportation of thousands of young men and women who were brought here as kids, have played by the rules and have done nothing wrong. Indeed, they're doing everything right by getting an education or serving in the military.\nBut if Mitt Romney gets into office, he has vowed to overturn that action, and veto the DREAM Act if it ever passes Congress. \nThe president has also told the people of Puerto Rico that when they express a clear desire to change their status, he will work to implement their will. And I know that Barack Obama will stand with my people the day they choose to have the same rights and responsibilities as their fellow American citizens.\n\nThis November, we're faced with the choice between moving forward or going backward. Let's fight for President Obama, because he has fought for us. Para atras, ni para coger impulso. Para adelante con Obama.\nGod bless America. Thank you. ", "Hello, Connecticut. Hello, everyone back home at Augie & Ray's. Hello, America. Thank you, North Carolina.\nI'm Chairman John Larson, chairman of the Democratic Caucus, America's caucus. But first and foremost and always, I'm the eldest son of Ray and Pauline and one of eight kids. I grew up in Mayberry Village, a federal housing project in East Hartford, Connecticut.\nMy dad worked as a fireman at Pratt Whitney aircraft, where Connecticut skilled workers and the best machinists in the world build the arsenal for our nation's democracy. When I'd ask my dad why he worked so hard every day, he'd say, got to keep the eagle flying.\nKeeping the eagle flying was more than a metaphor for building the most dependable aircraft engines in the world. It was about pride, the pride of a people who make things here in America; about the dignity of a fair wage for a hard day's work; about being able to send your kids to college; about getting good medical care and a secure retirement; about building a better future, not just for yourself but for your country.\nIt's what FDR called the warm courage of national unity.\nNow, for more than 40 years my mother has faced multiple sclerosis and, more recently, congestive heart failure, always with courage, a warm heart and a congenial spirit. Dad worried a lot about my mom's health, but he knew his pension from Pratt was steadily growing and that Social Security and Medicare guarantee that he and my mother could retire with dignity and security. For years, paycheck after paycheck, my dad did his part. Through Social Security and Medicare contributions, he paid it forward. Sadly, Dad didn't live long enough to benefit from it. Now my mother, facing dementia, requires round-the-clock care. Every cent, though, of my father's pension, every penny from those Social Security benefits goes to help pay her bills. Don't ever tell me or any American that's a handout. It's the insurance they paid for. \nWhenever we gather by Mom's bedside, she says to us she doesn't want to be a burden. Mom, you're not a burden. You're an inspiration. \nMy family's not alone. Millions of Americans rely on Social Security and Medicare.\nIn fact, for half our nation's seniors, it's the only thing standing between them and poverty.\nWhat Republicans don't get is that for so many people, like my family, this is personal \u2014 personal. \nMitt Romney, Paul Ryan have a different vision. Look at the details. The biggest problem with the Ryan-Romney plan for Medicare is obvious. They take away the Medicare. They end the guarantee, hand out vouchers, limit benefits and force seniors to pay the difference \u2014 you ready for this \u2014 of up to $6,400 out of their own pockets. Why? You know the answer, so they can cut taxes for the richest 1 percent. \nLook, everyone back home Augie & Ray's Drive In knows that ain't right. Are we going to let them take us backwards?Back to an American where winners take all the middle class picks up the tab?Are we going to let them destroy the safety net of Medicare just so the Romneys of this world can wire even more money into their Swiss and Cayman Island bank accounts?I know I'm preaching to the choir here tonight, but as the Sisters of Notre Dame would remind us, it's the choir that leads the singing.\nSo rise up! \nAnd as we stand together with President Obama, not only will the eagle keep flying, it will soar! God bless you. God bless America. ", "My name is Ken Myers. I'm a father, a teamster and a deputy sheriff from Carroll County, Iowa \u2014 \u2014 God's country. I'm lucky to walk a pretty quiet beat, as they say. But one evening last spring, two other officers and I answered a routine call to check in on an individual. One of my partners knocked on the front door of the house; I went around back. That's when, through a window, I saw a man with a gun, and he saw us. He started firing. We took cover, backup arrived, and we spent the night trying to convince the suspect to surrender. By morning, he walked out the door with his hands in the air. Thankfully, no one was hurt.\nFirst responders like me put our lives on the line. We're proud to do it. It's the job we signed up for: to protect and serve.\nBut we need a leader who will do the same for us. And that leader is President Barack Obama. \nGovernor Romney has said it's time for us to cut back on public employees like teachers, firefighters and cops. And that's exactly what his plan would do. When the Republican governor of Ohio attacked the collective bargaining rights of police officers, Romney supported him. The Romney-Ryan budget could cut federal funding for first responders by nearly 20 percent. That funding \u2014 it helps pay for the officers who heeded my call for backup last spring and for their training. It also helps pay for the fire and EMS vehicles that responded to the scene. And it helps pay for the bulletproof vests that if, God forbid, I was shot that night, could have saved my life.\nBut this isn't just about me or about my partners in the sheriff's office. It's about all Americans. In his big speech last week, Mitt Romney talked about helping families. We help families every day. And let me tell you, what Mitt Romney doesn't understand is that there's nothing helpful about undermining public safety. When you cut funding for first responders, that means there will be fewer of them, and that means help may take longer to get there or may get there far too late.\nPresident Obama understands that. That's why he has helped tens of thousands of cops on the job and helped create hundreds of new law enforcement positions across the country. He's made sure we're outfitted with the best equipment and the most advanced technology to keep us safe.\nIn New York City on 9/11 and on the Gulf Coast after Katrina, first responders saw our communications network break down, making it harder to get to the people we were trying to help.\nPresident Obama working to create a national safety communications system so that never happens again. \nIn places like Carrol County, we do things for ourselves. We're not strangers to hard work, but part of that work is looking out for our neighbors. That's why we need police, that's why we need firefighters and teachers and that's why we need a president who fights for us \u2014 \u2014 a president who stands up for the middle-class jobs and the middle-class communities.\nPresident Obama has our backs, and in this election, we have his. ", "Good evening, fellow Democrats. \nWhere I'm from, we dream big. We think different. And we invest in a future filled with possibility. President Obama understands that future. He knows this election is about creating jobs today. And that's why he's created 4.5 million of them, growing the economy from the middle out, not from the top down. But he also knows that it's about supporting the jobs of tomorrow. It's about making sure that kids in Charlotte can compete with kids in Shanghai. As a businessperson from the most dynamic and entrepreneurial place in the world, I can tell you this: No one has done more to help America with that competition than President Barack Obama. \nHe understands that creating the jobs of the future is about making education, and especially math and science, a top priority.\nThat means setting higher standards, providing more support to teachers and schools, and challenging states to innovate, because when it comes to education, we should be beating the rest of the world, not beating up on teachers. \nIt's about investing in research and development, so that from the dorm room to the boardroom, America can lead the world in developing new technologies. That's why the president has committed to accelerating research and proposed making the R&D tax credit permanent. It's about championing the exports of our entrepreneurs, because good jobs at home come from selling more goods abroad.\nYou know, four years ago, President Obama pledged to double American exports by 2015. Today we're more than 60 percent of the way there. \nIn Olney, Texas, a small company that sells firefighting and crop dusting airplanes has increased their exports by 50 percent. And as their CFO said, if we can do it in a small town that has three stoplights and one Dairy Queen, we can do it anywhere. And I promise you, thanks to this president, we will.\nAnd creating good jobs means training and retraining workers to succeed in a new century. That's why the president has proposed supporting partnerships between community colleges and businesses, to expand training for workers in high-growth sectors.\nMitt Romney and his Republican friends don't understand this 21st century. We open-source. They outsource. We welcome the immigrants who build our businesses. Romney wants them to self-deport. We're building an economy to last. They're chasing the last bubble.\nToday 300,000 Americans earn a living designing computer and smartphone applications. Once upon a time, if you'd suggested designing a game where you sling birds at pigs, they might have put you in an institution. Now you might become successful enough to endow an institution.\nSo in the public school, where my two children go to school, we wanted to offer a great school course in designing computer applications. But none of the teachers knew how. So two seventh- graders created their own class, and they've been oversubscribed ever since. Our kids are leading the way. It's up to us to match their creativity with our commitment.\nWe need a president who understands how to make their dreams a reality and build a brighter future for us all. That's why America needs Barack Obama.\nThank you, Democrats. Thank you. ", "Many years ago my grandfather came to this country with nothing, nothing more than a willingness to work hard.\nTwo generations later his granddaughter became the first Chinese- American woman elected to Congress in history. That's the American dream.\nNo one ever said that achieving the American dream was easy. And it wasn't. From the moment my grandfather came here, he faced the discriminatory laws of the time, laws that stopped Chinese-Americans from becoming naturalized citizens, from voting, from owning land and even from being hired in any corporation.\nBut he decided to make something of himself anyway. He opened up a small Chinese restaurant. He worked night and day and day and night. He used that very expensive labor, his sons. And though there were moments when it seemed hard to make ends meet, he still supported his family. It was my grandfather's dream for his family, his children and grandchildren that kept him working for 15 hours a day, seven days a week for decades. It was the American dream that kept him going to lift up our family.\nToday President Obama wants to ensure that same opportunity to achieve the American dream is available for all families.\nThe American dream is why President Obama made the largest investment in college affordability in our nation's history. \nDespite all the good that President Obama has done, Republicans have attacked him at every step. They even turned health care reform into what they thought was a bad word, \"Obamacare.\" At first, I resented that term. But then I realized that this was the perfect phrase. \"Obamacare\" is perfect because President Obama cares. \nObama cares about the education of our children and the security of our seniors. Obama cares about our diverse communities. Obama cares about the middle class that makes America great. Obama cares about small business and big values: justice, equality and opportunity.\nAnd Romney? Well, when the American auto industry and its workers faced hard times, Mitt Romney said, let Detroit go bankrupt.\n\nWhen young people came to our country as children and turned to the DREAM Act as a way to participate in our nation's future, Mitt Romney said that he would veto it. President Obama gave these patriotic young people a real chance to be a part of America's success. \nWhen seniors facing serious illnesses like cancer need Medicare, Mitt Romney said he would turn it into a voucher system, breaking the guarantee of coverage and costing seniors more than $6,000 out of pocket. President Obama invested in Medicare and added years to its life. \nLet me ask you, who do you think cares about you, cares about the middle class? The answer is clear: Barack Obama. President Obama cares about all Americans, regardless of where we came from, when our families got here, what we look like, what our last names are and whether we're middle class or working hard to get there.\nThe strength of the American dream is that we all have the opportunity to climb up the ladder, just like my grandfather did. The strength of President Obama is that he will make sure that ladder is sturdy, the steps are close together and that we all have a shot at the American dream. To strengthen the American dream, let's re-elect President Obama! ", "Good evening, Charlotte. \nSo it's an honor to be here tonight with so many people determined to move our country forward.\nI know all Americans are proud to carry the torch of progress. And in Boston, we take that job very seriously.\nMitt Romney, he may come from Boston, but his campaign values aren't Boston values \u2014 \nIn Boston, we know government isn't the answer or the enemy \u2014 it's our partner. And in Boston, like many cities across this country, we're seeing progress all around us today. In large part it's because this president, this administration gave ordinary people a leg up: construction jobs afforded by recovery act dollars, better schools pushed by the president's education reform, growing hospitals and health centers and booming life science companies born from national research support.\nSo today we stand with President Obama and his plan to lead us forward.\nNow, Mitt Romney might be a nice guy. As the mayor of Boston, I worked with him when he was governor. Much of the time we worked sometimes together pretty well. But he made a lot of decisions that were bad for our state, and now he wants to carry those wrongheaded policies to the rest of our country.\nMitt Romney \u2014 Romney spends a lot of time in this campaign talking about the business experience, about how, if elected, he'll create lots of jobs. I've been thinking about this pitch; it sounds so familiar. You know why? Because it's the same thing he said when he ran for governor of Massachusetts. He promised to bring business to the state, but when he was in office, Massachusetts was 47th out of all 50 states in our country in job creation. \nThere's a reason for that, folks, because Governor Romney cut education. He cut workforce training. He disguised his tax hikes as fees. He still our long-term debt by $2.6 billion.\nMitt likes the business speech. Think of me as a reference check. In Massachusetts, Mitt Romney had the one job in his life that's close to being president, and he wasn't all that good at that. Mitt Romney talked last week about broken promises.\nWell, he would know. Even worse, Governor Romney is now running away from major accomplishments \u2014 a health care reform that he called immortal for our country. I like Mitt Romney, but he's learned all the wrong lessons, and now he's doubling down on the \u2014 all the wrong plans. His campaign is based in Boston, a city moving forward, but his ideas would set our country back.\nUp in Boston, we have a plaque that says: Paul Revere started a ride, which in a way has never ended. That's true about our country, too. In every generation, the American people have taken up that ride, pushing the United States forward. We're never going back.\nSo, today we have a clear choice to make. Will we move forward together, or we'll go back to the tricks \u2014 trickle-down philosophies that Mitt Romney believes in?The choice is clear. It's time to keep moving forward. It's time to re-elect Barack Obama as president of the United States. Thank you, Charlotte, and have a great night. ", "Good evening, Demorats. I'm so honored to join here tonight.\nCertainly this close to election, much of our attention and focus is on the nuts and bolts to victory: how we'll prevail in the swing districts and the battleground states.\nBut this convention gives us a chance to discuss something much more important than how or where we fight. It gives us a chance to reflect on the question of why we fight. And the answer to that fundamental question is summed up in one word: opportunity.\nOpportunity is why we fight. Across the country, there are parents who want nothing more than the opportunity to have a job and the ability to put food on the family table. We fight for them.\nIn too many states, even some folks who have jobs wake up every morning worrying that they may lose their job simply because they're gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. We fight for them. \nOn our nation's campuses \u2014 on our nation's campuses, students are seeking the opportunity to go to college, earn a degree and find a career that will unleash their full potential. We fight for them.\nWomen across our country are fighting for the opportunity that comes with equal pay for equal work and the respect that comes with having control of their medical decisions. We fight for them.\nInmigrantes de todo el mundo llegan a los Estados Unidos buscando una oportunidad para darles a sus hijos una mejor vida. Nosotros luchamos por ellos. Yes, we fight for them. \nAnd we fight \u2014 we fight for President Obama, and we know he fights for us. President Obama has fought to renew the opportunity for Americans every moment of his time in office, to protect opportunities that already exist and create new opportunities for all Americans.\nWhen the jobs of auto workers were threatened in 2009, some said: Let Detroit fail. But President Obama said that failure was not an option. And today, American auto workers can sleep securely, knowing their jobs and the opportunities for a brighter future exist because President Obama fought for them. \nPresident Obama has reformed student loans \u2014 cut out the big banks and lowered the cost of education for millions of students. And he's fighting for new investments to extend that opportunity for millions more.\nHe helped repeal \"don't ask, don't tell,\" giving LGBT Americans the opportunity to openly and proudly serve our nation in uniform. And he's standing up for the right of those of us in the LGBT community \u2014 \nHe's fought \u2014 he's fought for policies that unleash the opportunities that come with 21st century jobs that will remake our economy and restore prosperity for the middle class.\nPresident Obama is leading us through a challenging era by recognizing that the strength of America is measured in the opportunity everyone has to work hard and succeed. That's the spirit of our party and the guiding principle of our president. This election is our opportunity to rededicate ourselves to that commitment. Our pathway to victory is to fight for everyone to have the opportunity to live their American Dream; to fight for our proud national tradition of ensuring that our children always enjoy more opportunities than their parents had; to fight to ensure that every person has the opportunities that come with being treated with dignity, respect and equality in the eyes of the law.\nWe fight to restore opportunity across this country, because as Democrats, we understand the poignancy, the power and the truth of Ralph Waldo Emerson's observation that America is another name for opportunity. Opportunity is why we fight for our country, opportunity is what our president fights for and in 61 days, opportunity is why President Barack Obama will win a second term in office. \nBut we have a lot of work to do between now and then, so let's get to work. Thank you. ", "Friends and fellow delegates, my husband and I have raised two accomplished daughters who we taught what my parents and grandparents taught me and my three sisters. My sisters and I were encouraged to choose the direction of our lives.\nWe became a congresswoman, a stay-at-home mom, a filmmaker and a journalist.\nAnd Lino and I taught our children that they could rise to even greater heights. They could become surgeons, CEOs, Supreme Court justices, secretary of state and even president of the United States. \nWe didn't teach our daughters that they were second-class citizens. With proposal after proposal, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan want to make women second-class citizens again. \nAs a fourth-generation Coloradoan, I believe that our Western spirit is an inspiration for what makes America great. Westerners stand strong in our defense of individual rights and women's equality. \nThe achievements we've achieved did not come easily. Many opposed the advance of women into new roles and responsibilities. They even opposed our right to vote. But working together, we have established our rightful place in our American republic. Even today, though, there are still many battles to be won. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan would have us fighting to defend old gains all over again.\nMore and more in this economy, the women are the family breadwinners.\nWe are managing our family by just struggling to pay health care bills and facing the challenge of saving for college. We feel it in our paychecks when we receive only 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. President Obama understands how unfair this is. That's why the very first bill he signed was the Lilly Ledbetter Act to strengthen a woman's right to demand equal pay for doing the exact same job. \nBut look what \u2014 look what the Romney-Ryan ticket would do: cut Pell Grants which make college affordable; repeal the Affordable Care Act that finally prohibits discrimination by insurance companies when they charge women more than men for health insurance. The Romney-Ryan ticket promises to slash Planned Parenthood funding that helps women get affordable cancer screening and family planning services. Romney and Ryan support the so-called personhood amendment that would ban many forms of birth control, would ban all abortions, even in the cases of rape, incest or to save a mother's life \u2014 \u2014 ban invitro fertilization, which helps families have children of their own, and it would even ban embryonic stem cell research, which holds the promise to cure so many diseases.\nBut, although these restrictions on women's rights are all Republican ideas, and even in their platform, my friends across the aisle now try to change the subject. It's the economy, they cry. And you know what? They're right. When they break the guarantee of Medicare, it will hurt women and families right in the pocketbook. When they \u2014 \u2014 when they allow insurance companies to deny coverage based solely on the pre-existing condition of being a woman, it hurts women and families right in the pocketbook.\nWhen they take away the guarantee of coverage for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings in the Affordable Care Act, it will hurt women and families right in the pocketbook. And that's what this debate is all about.\nIn short, the Romney-Ryan ticket would reverse more than a century of hard-fought progress for women. Mr. Romney, Mr. Ryan, the women of America have a message for you: We're not going back. ", "Tonight I want to celebrate a fundamental reason we are Democrats. We believe that America is never greater than when we protect the rights we have won and strive to make real the call of our founders to create a more perfect union. We are never more American than when we demand that all people are treated with dignity and respect. And we are never more patriotic than when we see a group of people being cast aside and say stop. In America, we do not tolerate anyone being treated unfairly.\nWe are truly American when we live up to our original promise of liberty and celebrate those who \u2014 quintessentially American words, \"All men are created equal.\" \nMy friends, on June 15th, President Obama made those words real. They are students and volunteers and leaders. Many want to join the armed forces. They are true Americans. They are American in every way except on paper.\nPresident Obama stood up for people like my friend Jessica from Chicago. Jessica had a 3.8 GPA in high school. She has a scholarship to the great University of North Carolina. \nNow America faces a stark choice. The future of a generation will be decided in this election. We cannot deny them justice. President Obama is protecting immigrants; Mitt Romney wants undocumented immigrants to self-deport. This election will determine whether high school valedictorians, football team captains and student council presidents will be treated with respect or treated like suspects, whether they reach their dreams or whether Mitt Romney turns their dreams into nightmares.\nThis belief separates our parties. Democrats have always been the party of expanding the embrace of our democracy and our humanity. It's not just \"DREAMers.\" Democrats value all immigrants. Republicans blame undocumented immigrants for many of our problems. Democrats will fight for comprehensive immigration reform, and keep America secure and keep our immigrant families united. \nImmigration reform stops the finger-pointing and allows immigrants to make America stronger. Here's what immigration reform means for Hector Nunez. Hector is a U.S. citizen born here in this country, and he's a soldier, a combat engineer in the U.S. Army. You know what Hector's job is? He locates and eliminates roadside bombs in Afghanistan. Hector risks his life so that we can be safe. Hector and his wife Rosa, they have a beautiful citizen son, Jason. Rosa's an immigrant. To finalize her citizenship, Rosa was told to return to Mexico. But when the family went, Rosa was told she couldn't come back to America. She was told to stay behind as our government sent her proud and courageous husband Hector back to deploy in Afghanistan. That's not the America of Barack Obama, and that's the America we're going to change. \nOur immigration system creates stories like this everyday, good people torn apart, kept from working, paying taxes, serving in the armed forces, keeping us safe. In any language, the choice is clear. En esa eleccion, hay una decision clara, alternativas claras. Barack Obama dice, voy a proteger los inmigrantes y permitir que los jovenes se queden aqui en este pais.\n\nThe obstruction of the Republican Party and Mitt Romney is not new. Every time we've expanded civil rights in America, someone tried to stop us. From marriage equality to voting rights, someone will fight against expanding the rights enjoyed by some Americans to all Americans. There is always someone who says: These rights, these liberties and this equality is just for me; it's not for you.\nThis election, please join me in standing by Barack Obama. Help our president show that in America, freedom, equality are for all of us all of the time. Thank you so much. ", "Thank you. Thank you so much.With your help. With your help. \nLet me \u2014 let me start. I want \u2014 I want to \u2014 want to start by thanking Elaine. Elaine, thank you so much. We are so grateful \u2014 \nOver the past few years as first lady I have had the extraordinary privilege of traveling all across this country. And everywhere I've gone and the people I've met and the stories I've heard, I have seen the very best of the American spirit.\nI have seen it in the incredible kindness and warmth that people have shown me and my family, especially our girls. I've seen it in teachers in a near-bankrupt school district who vowed to keep teaching without pay. I've seen in people who become heroes at a moment's notice, diving into harm's way to save others, flying across the country to put out a fire, driving for hours to bail out a flooded town. And I've seen it in our men and women in uniform and our proud military families \u2014 \nEvery day the people I meet inspire me. Every day they make me proud. Every day they remind me how blessed we are to live in the greatest nation on earth. \nServing as your first lady is an honor and a privilege. But back when we first came together four years ago, I still had some concerns about this journey we'd begun. While I believed deeply in my husband's vision for this country and I was certain he would make an extraordinary president \u2014 \u2014 like any mother I would worried about what it would mean for our girls if he got that chance.\nYou know, how will we keep them grounded under the glare of the national spotlight? How would they feel being uprooted from their school, their friends and the only home they'd ever known?\nSee, our life before moving to Washington was filled with simple joys: Saturdays at soccer games, Sundays at Grandma's house, and a date night for Barack and me was either dinner or a movie, because as an exhausted mom, I couldn't stay awake for both. \nAnd the truth is, I loved the life we had built for our girls. And I deeply loved the man I had built that life with. And I didn't want that to change if he became president. \nI loved Barack just the way he was. You see, even back then when Barack was a senator and a presidential candidate, he was still the guy who picked me up for our dates in a car that was so rusted out \u2014 \u2014 I could actually see the pavement going by in a hole in the passenger side door.\nHe was the guy whose proudest possession was a coffee table he'd found in a dumpster \u2014 \nBut see, when Barack started telling me about his family, see, now, that's when I knew I had found a kindred spirit, someone whose values and upbringing were so much like mine.\nYou see, Barack and I were both raised by families who didn't have much in the way of money or material possessions but who had given us something far more valuable: their unconditional love, their unflinching sacrifice \u2014 \u2014 and the chance to go places they had never imagined for themselves.\nMy father was a pump operator at the city water plant, and he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when my brother and I were young. And even as a kid, I knew there were plenty of days when he was in pain, and I knew there were plenty of mornings when it was a struggle for him to simply get out of bed. But every morning I watched my father wake up with a smile, grab his walker, prop himself up against the bathroom sink and slowly shave and button his uniform. And when he returned home after a long day's work, my brother and I would stand at the top of the stairs of our little apartment patiently waiting to greet him, watching as he reached down to lift one leg and then the other to slowly climb his way into our arms.\nBut despite these challenges, my dad hardly ever missed a day of work. He and my mom were determined to give me the kind of education they could only dream of. And when my brother and I finally made it to college, nearly all of our tuition came from student loans and grants, but my dad still had to pay a tiny portion of that tuition himself. And every semester, he was determined to pay that bill right on time, even taking out loans when he fell short.\nHe was so proud to be sending his kids to college, and he made sure we never missed a registration deadline because his check was late.\nYou see, for my dad, that's what it meant to be a man. Like \u2014 like so many of us, that was the measure of his success in life, being able to earn a decent living that allowed him to support his family.\nAnd \u2014 and as I got to know Barack, I realized that even though he had grown up all the way across the country, he'd been brought up just like me. Barack was raised by a single mom who struggled to pay the bills and by grandparents who stepped in when she needed help. Barack's grandmother started out as a secretary at a community bank, and she moved quickly up the ranks. But like so many women, she hit a glass ceiling. And for years, men no more qualified than she was, men she had actually trained, were promoted up the ladder ahead of her, earning more and more money while Barack's family continued to scrape by. But day after day, she kept on waking up at dawn to catch the bus, arriving at work before anyone else, giving her best without complaint or regret. And \u2014 and she would often tell Barack, so long as you kids do well, Bar , that's all that really matters.\nLike \u2014 like so many American families, our families weren't asking for much. They didn't begrudge anyone else's success or care that others had much more than they did. In fact, they admired it. They \u2014 they simply believed in that fundamental American promise, that even if you don't start out with much, if you work hard and do what you're supposed to do, you should be able to build a decent life for yourself and an even better life for your kids and grandkids.\nThat's how they raised us. That's what we learned from their example.\nWe learned about dignity and decency, that how hard you work matters more than how much you make, that helping others means more than just getting ahead yourself. \u2014 or play by your own set of rules, and success doesn't count unless you earn it fair and square.\nWe learned about gratitude and humility, that so many people had a hand in our success, from the teachers who inspired us to the janitors who kept our school clean. And we were taught to value everyone's contribution and treat everyone with respect.\nThose are the values that Barack and I and so many of you are trying to pass on to our own children. That's who we are. And standing before you four years ago, I knew that I didn't want any of that to change if Barack became president. Well, today, after so many struggles and triumphs and moments that have tested my husband in ways I never could have imagined, I have seen firsthand that being president doesn't change who you are. No, it reveals who you are. \nYou see, I've gotten to see up close and personal what being president really looks like. And I've seen how the issues that come across the president's desk are always the hard ones. You know, the problems where no amount of data or numbers will get you to the right answer. The judgment calls where the stakes are so high and there is no margin for error.\nAnd as president, you're going to get all kinds of advice from all kinds of people. But at the end of the day, when it comes time to make that decision as president, all you have to guide you are your values and your vision and the life experiences that make you who you are. \nSo when it \u2014 when it comes to rebuilding our economy, Barack is thinking about folks like my dad and like his grandmother. He's thinking about the pride that comes from a hard day's work. That's why he signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, to help women get equal pay for equal work. \nThat's why he cut taxes for working families and small businesses and fought to get the auto industry back on its feet. \nThat's how he brought our economy from the brink of collapse to creating jobs again, jobs you can raise a family on, good jobs, right here in the United States of America. \nWhen it comes to the health of our families, Barack refused to listen to all those folks who told him to leave health reform for another day, another president. \nHe did it because he believes that here in America, our grandparents should be able to afford their medicine, our kids should be able to see a doctor when they're sick, and no one in this country should ever go broke because of an accident or an illness. \nAnd he believes that women are more than capable of making our own choices about our bodies and our health care. That's what my husband stands for.\nWhen it comes to giving our kids the education they deserve, Barack knows that, like me and like so many of you, he never could have attended college without financial aid. And believe it or not, when we were first married, our combined monthly student loan bill was actually higher than our mortgage. \u2014 because he wants every young person to fulfill their promise and be able to attend college without a mountain of debt.\nSo in the end, for Barack, these issues aren't political; they're personal, because Barack knows what it means when a family struggles. He knows what it means to want something more for your kids and grandkids. Barack knows the American dream because he's lived it. And he wants everyone \u2014 \nAnd he believes that when you've worked hard and done well and walked through that doorway of opportunity, you do not slam it shut behind you. No, you reach back \u2014 \u2014 and you give other folks the same chances that helped your succeed.\nSo when people ask me whether being in the White House has changed my husband, I can honestly say that when it comes to his character and his convictions and his heart, Barack Obama is still the same man I fell in love with all those years ago. Yeah. \nHe's the same man \u2014 he's the same man, when our girls were first born, would anxiously check their cribs every few minutes to ensure that they were still breathing \u2014 \u2014 proudly showing them off to everyone we knew.\nYou see, that's the man who sits down with me and our girls for dinner nearly every night, patiently answering questions about issues in the news, strategizing about middle school friendships. That's the man I see in those quiet moments late at night, hunched over his desk, poring over the letters people have sent him, the letter from the father struggling to pay his bills, from the woman dying of cancer whose insurance company won't cover her care, from the young people with so much promise but so few opportunities.And I see the concern in his eyes, and I hear the determination in his voice as he tells me, you won't believe what these folks are going through, Michelle; it's not right; we've got to keep working to fix this; we've got so much more to do. \nI see \u2014I see how those stories \u2014I see how those stories, our collection of struggles and hopes and dreams \u2014 I see how that's what drives Barack Obama every single day. And I didn't think that it was possible, but let me tell you today I love my husband even more than I did four years ago, even more than I did 23 years ago when we first met. \nLet me tell you why.\nSee, I love that he has never forgotten how he started. I love that we can trust Barack to do what he says he's going to do even when it's hard, especially when it's hard.\nYou know, I love that for Barack, there is no such thing as us and them. He doesn't care whether you're a Democrat, a Republican or none of the above. He knows that we all love our country, and he is always ready to listen to a good idea. He's always looking for the very best in everyone he meets.\nAnd I love that even in the toughest moments, when we're all sweating it \u2014 \nAnd he reminds me \u2014 he reminds me that we are playing a long game here, and that change is hard, and change is slow, and it never happens all at once, but eventually we get there. We always do. We get there because of folks like my dad, folks like Barack's grandmother, men and women who said to themselves, I may not have a chance to fulfill my dreams, but maybe my children will, maybe my grandchildren will. See, so many of us stand here tonight because of their sacrifice and longing and steadfast love, because time and again, they swallowed their fears and doubts and did what was hard.\n\nSo today when the challenges we face start to seem overwhelming or even impossible, let us never forget that doing the impossible is the history of this nation. \nAnd if our parents and grandparents could toil and struggle for us, you know, if they could raise beams of steel to the sky, send a man to the Moon, connect the world with a touch of a button, then surely we can keep on sacrificing and building for our own kids and grandkids, right? \nAnd if so many great men and women could wear our country's uniform and sacrifice their lives for our most fundamental rights, then surely we can do our part as citizens of this great democracy to exercise those rights. Surely we can get to the polls on Election Day and make our voices heard. \nIf farmers and blacksmiths could win independence from an empire, if immigrants could leave behind everything they knew for a better life on our shores, if women could be dragged to jail for seeking to vote, if a generation could defeat a depression and define greatness for all time, if a young preacher could lift us to the mountaintop with his righteous dream \u2014 \u2014 then surely, surely we can give everyone in this country a fair chance at that great American dream.\nBecause in the end \u2014 in the end, more than anything else, that is the story of this country, the story of unwavering hope grounded in unyielding struggle. That is what has made my story and Barack's story and so many other American stories possible.\nAnd let me tell you something, I say all of this tonight not just as first lady, no, not just as a wife. You see, at the end of the day, my most important title is still mom in chief. \u2014 that belief that here in America, there is always something better out there if you're willing to work for it, then we must work like never before.\n\nThank you. God bless you. God bless America.\n(Cheers, applause.", "Wow. What's a mom like me doing in a place like this?\nI'm not even a political person, but what I am is a military mom. \nThey are a mom's most precious treasures. And I don't know when I'm going to get them together again because one of them is always deploying. But because of Dr. Biden and the first lady, our lives are a little bit easier. Along with President Obama, they have made helping military families a top priority. They've brought together the American people, including thousands of businesses, to become part of a nationwide support network. It is honor and respect in action, and it warms this mother's heart. \nLast December I wrote Michelle Obama a Christmas card, just a mom-to-mom note to say thank you for caring. The first lady not only read my letter, she invited my husband and I to the White House. It was an amazing experience. But what's even more amazing is knowing that our commander in chief and first lady are thinking about families like mine every single day.\nSo \u2014 \nThat's why I am so proud to introduce my fellow mom and our first lady, Michelle Obama. ", "Thank you. Thank you.\nMy fellow Democrats, my fellow Americans, my fellow Texans \u2014 \nThe unlikely journey that brought me here tonight began many miles from this podium. My brother Joaquin and I grew up with my mother, Rosie, and my grandmother, Victoria. My grandmother was an orphan. As a young girl, she had to leave her home in Mexico and move to San Antonio, where some relatives had agreed to take her in. She never made it past the fourth grade; she had to drop out and start working to help her family.\nMy grandmother spent her whole life working as a maid, a cook and a baby sitter, barely scraping by but still working hard to give my mother, her only child, a chance in life so that my mother could give my brother and me an even better one. \nAs my grandmother got older, she begged my mother to give her grandchildren. She prayed to God for just one grandbaby before she died. You can imagine her excitement when she found out her prayers would be answered twice over. She was so excited that the day before Joaquin and I were born, she entered a menudo cook-off, and she won $300. That's how she paid our hospital bill.\nBy the time Joaquin and I came along, this incredible woman had taught herself to read and write in both Spanish and English. I can still see her in the room that Joaquin and I shared with her, reading her Agatha Christie novels late in to the night. And I can still remember her every morning, as Joaquin and I walked out the front door to school, making the sign of the cross behind us saying, que dios los bendiga \u2014 may God bless you. \nMy grandmother didn't live to see us begin our lives in public service, but she probably would have thought it extraordinary that just two generations after she arrived in San Antonio, one grandson would be the mayor and the other would be on his way, the good people of San Antonio willing, to the United States Congress. \nMy family story isn't special. What's special is the America that makes our story possible. Ours is a nation like no other, a place where great journeys can be made in a single generation.\nNo matter who you are or where you come from, the path is always forward. \nAmerica didn't become the land of opportunity by accident. My grandmother's generation and generations before always saw beyond the horizons of their own lives and their own circumstances. They believed that opportunity created today would lead to prosperity tomorrow. That's the country they envisioned, and that's the country they helped build. The roads and bridges they built, the schools and universities they created, the rights they fought for and won, these open the doors to a decent job, a secure retirement, the chance for your children to do better than you did. And that's the middle class, the engine of our economic growth. \nThe dream of raising a family in a place where hard work is rewarded is not unique to Americans. It's a human dream, one that calls across oceans and borders. The dream is universal. But America makes it possible. And our investment in opportunity makes it a reality. \nNow, in Texas \u2014 And we expect folks to pull themselves up by them. But we also recognize that there are some things we can't do alone.\nWe have to come together and invest in opportunity today for prosperity tomorrow. \nAnd it starts with education. \nThey had the same talent, the same brains, the same dreams as the folks we sat with at Stanford and Harvard. I realized the difference wasn't one of intelligence or drive. The difference was opportunity. \nIn my city of San Antonio, we get that. So we're working to ensure that more four-year-olds have access to pre-K. \nWe know that pre-K and student loans aren't charity; they're a smart investment in a workforce that can fill and create the jobs of tomorrow. We're investing in young minds today to be competitive in the global economy tomorrow. And it's paying off. Last year, the Milken Institute ranked San Antonio as the nation's top-performing local economy, and we're only getting started. \nOpportunity today, prosperity tomorrow. \nNow, like many of you, I watched last week's Republican convention. \nMitt Romney quite simply doesn't get it. A few months ago, he visited a university in Ohio and gave students there a little entrepreneurial advice. start a business, he said. But how? Borrow money, if you have to, from your parents, he told them. Some people are lucky enough to borrow money from their parents, but that shouldn't determine whether you can pursue your dreams \u2014 not in America, not here, not in the 21st century.\nI don't think Governor Romney meant any harm. I think he's a good guy. He just has no idea how good he's had it. We know that in our free market economy, some will prosper more than others. What we don't accept is the idea that some folks won't even get a chance. And the thing is, Mitt Romney and the Republican Party are perfectly comfortable with that America.\nIn fact, that's exactly what they're promising us. The Romney-Ryan budget doesn't just cut public education, cut Medicare, cut transportation and cut job training. It doesn't just pummel the middle class; it dismantles it. It dismantles what generations before have built to ensure that everybody can enter and stay in the middle class. When it comes to getting the middle class back to work, Mitt Romney says no.When it comes to respecting women's rights, Mitt Romney says no.When it comes to letting people love who they love and marry who they want to marry, Mitt Romney says no.When it comes to expanding access to good health care, Mitt Romney \u2014Actually \u2014 \u2014 actually, Mitt Romney said yes, and now he says no.Governor Romney has undergone an extreme makeover. So here's what we're going to say to Mitt Romney in November: We're going to say no.Of all the fictions we heard last week in Tampa, the one I find most troubling is this: if we all just go our own way, our nation will be stronger for it, because if we sever the threads that connect us, the only people who will go far are those who are already ahead. We all understand that freedom isn't free. What Romney and Ryan don't understand is that neither is opportunity. We have to invest in it. \nRepublicans tell us that if the most prosperous among us do even better that somehow the rest of us will too. \nBut Barack Obama gets it. He understands that when we invest in people, we're investing in our shared prosperity, and when we neglect that responsibility, we risk our promise as a nation. Just a few years ago families that had never asked for anything found themselves at risk of losing everything, and the dream my grandmother held that work would be rewarded, that the middle class would be there, if not for her, then for her children \u2014 that dream was being crushed.\nBut then President Obama took office, and he took action. When Detroit was in trouble, President Obama saved the auto industry and saved a million jobs. He made a historic investment to lift our nation's public schools and expanded Pell Grants so that more young people can afford college. And because he knows that we don't have an ounce of talent to waste, the president took action to lift the shadow of deportation from a generation of young law-abiding immigrants called \"DREAMers.\"\n\nFour years ago, America stood on the brink of a depression. Despite incredible odds and united Republican opposition, our president took action. And now we've seen 4.5 million new jobs. He knows better than anyone that there is more hard work to do. But we're making progress.\nAnd now we need to make a choice. It's a choice between a country where the middle class pays more so that millionaires can pay less, or a country where everybody pays their fair share so we can reduce the deficit and create the jobs of the future. \nIt's a choice between a nation that slashes funding for our schools and guts Pell Grants, or a nation that invests more in education. And it's a choice between a politician who rewards companies that ship American jobs overseas or a leader who brings jobs back home. This is the choice before us.\nAnd to me, to my generation and for all the generations to come, our choice is clear. Our choice is a man who's always chosen us, a man who already is our president: Barack Obama. In the end, the American dream \u2014 the American dream is not a sprint, or even a marathon, but a relay. Our families don't always cross the finish line in the span of one generation, but each generation passes on to the next the fruits of their labor.\nMy grandmother never owned a house. She cleaned other people's houses so she could afford to rent her own. But she saw her daughter become the first in her family to graduate from college. \nAnd while she may \u2014 while she may be proud of me tonight, I got to tell you: Mom, I'm even more proud of you. \u2014 a couple of Mondays ago was her first day of pre-K, and as we dropped her off, we walked out of the classroom and I found myself whispering to her as was once whispered to me: \"Que Dios te bendiga\" \u2014 may God bless you.\n\nShe's still young, and her dreams are far off yet. But I hope she'll reach them. \nAs a dad, I'm going to do my part, and I know she'll do hers. But our responsibility as a nation is to come together and do our part as one community, one United States of America, to ensure opportunity for all of our children.\nThe days we live in are not easy ones. But we have seen days like this before, and America prevailed. With the wisdom of our founders and the values of our families, America prevailed. With each generation going further than the last, America prevailed, and with the opportunity we build today for a shared prosperity tomorrow, America will prevail.\nIt begins with re-electing Barack Obama. It begins with you. It begins now. Que Dios los bendiga. May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you. ", "Thank you. Thank you. Tonight I have the honor of introducing you to our keynote speaker, my twin brother, San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro. \nAs you can imagine, this is a very special moment for our family. For each of us, the places that we call home shape our character, inform how we see the world and inspire our imagination. Julian is a proud Texan. For 18 years \u2014 \u2014 for 18 years we shared a small room and big dreams in our neighborhood on the west side of San Antonio. Our hometown is a beautiful place, a place of hardworking, humble folks who grind out a living by day and go home and say prayers of thanks to God at night.\nSince becoming mayor in 2009, Julian has worked tirelessly to pursue policies that honor the aspirations of the people he represents. I'm proud that my brother has archived his dreams, but I'm even more proud of the work he's done to help others achieve theirs. Today, San Antonio is our nation's seventh-largest city \u2014 a city on the rise that looks like America tomorrow. Julian's also a dedicated husband to his wife, Erica, a public school teacher, and a wonderful father to his 3-year-old daughter Carina.\nSo it's with much love and pride that I present to you my best friend, my twin brother, San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro. ", "Good evening, Democrats. Are you fired up? \nWell, I hope so.\nThis is the election of a lifetime because more than any one candidate or party, what's at stake is the American dream. That dream, the ability to imagine a better way for ourselves and our families and then to reach for it, that dream is central to who we are and what we stand for as a nation. Whether that dream endures for another generation depends on you and me. And it also depends on who leads us.\nIn Massachusetts, we know Mitt Romney. By the time he left office, Massachusetts was 47th in the nation in job creation during better economic times, and household income in our state was declining. He cut education deeper than anywhere else in America. Roads and bridges were crumbling. Business taxes were up, and business confidence was down. Our clean energy potential was stalled, and we had a structural budget deficit. Mitt Romney talks a lot about all the things he's fixed. I can tell you Massachusetts was not one of them. \nHe's a fine fellow and a great salesman. But as governor, he was a lot more interested in having the job than doing the job. Today, with the help of the Obama administration, we are rebuilding our roads and our bridges and expanding broadband access.\nToday, we're out of the deficit hole Mr. Romney left, and we've achieved the highest bond rating in our history. Today \u2014 today, with labor at the table, we've made the reforms in our pension and benefit system, our schools, our transportation system and more, that Mr. Romney only talked about.\nAnd today in Massachusetts, you can marry whomever you love. \nWe still have more to do \u2014 much, much more to do. But we are on a better track because we placed our faith not in trickle-down fantasies and divisive rhetoric, but in our values and our common sense.\nThe same choice faces the nation today. All that Republicans are saying is that if we just shrink government, cut taxes, crush unions and wait \u2014 all will be well.\nNever mind that those are the very policies that got us into recession to begin with. \nBut we Democrats, we owe America more than a strong argument for what we are against. We need to be just as strong about what it is we are for. The question is \u2014 the question is, what do we believe?\nWell, we believe in an economy that grows opportunity out to the middle class and the disenfranchised, not just up to the well- connected.\nWe believe that freedom means keeping government out of our most private affairs, including out of a woman's decision whether to keep an unwanted pregnancy, and everybody's decision about whom to marry. \nWe believe that we owe the next generation a better country than we found and that every American has a stake in that. We believe that in times like these, we should turn to each other, not on each other. \nAnd we believe that government has a role to play, not in solving every problem in everybody's life, but in helping people help themselves to the American dream.\nThat's what Democrats believe. That's what Americans believe. And if we want to win elections in November and keep our country moving forward, if we want to earn the privilege to lead, my message is this: it's time for Democrats to grow a backbone and stand up for what we believe. \nQuit waiting. \nAnd let's all start by standing up for President Barack Obama. This is the president \u2014 this is the president who delivered the security of affordable health care to every single American in every corner of this country after 90 years of trying.\n\nThis is the president who brought Osama bin Laden to justice, who ended the war in Iraq and is ending the war in Afghanistan. \nThis is the president who ended \"don't ask, don't tell\" so that love of country, not love of another, determines fitness for service, who made equal pay for equal work the law of the land. \nThis is the president who saved the American auto industry from extinction \u2014 \nMy friends, the list of accomplishments is long, impressive and barely told, and even more impressive when you consider that congressional Republicans have made obstruction itself the centerpiece of their governing strategy. \nWith a record like that and a vision that hopeful and powerful, I, for one, will not stand by and let him be bullied out of office, and neither should you. \nI want you to be clear. What's at stake is real. It's real.\nThe Orchard Gardens elementary school in Boston was in trouble. Its record was poor, its spirit was broken and its reputation was a wreck.\nNo matter how bad things were in other urban schools in the city, people would say, well, at least we're not Orchard Gardens.\nToday, thanks to a host of new tools \u2014 many enacted with the help of the Obama administration \u2014 \u2014 Orchard Gardens went from one of the worst schools in the district to one of the best in the state. The whole school community is engaged and proud. So am I.\nAt the end of my visit about a year and a half ago, the first grade, led by a veteran teacher, gathered to recite Dr. King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech. And when I started to applaud, the teacher said: Not yet, Governor. Then she began to ask those 6- and 7-year-olds questions. What, she asked, does creed mean? What does nullification mean? Where is Stone Mountain? And as the hands of those 6- and 7- year-olds shot up, I realized that she had taught the children not just to memorize that speech but to understand it. \nSee, today's Republicans \u2014 today's Republicans and their nominee for president tell us that those first-graders are on their own \u2014 on their own to deal with their poverty, with ill-prepared young parents, maybe who speak English as a second language, with an underfunded school, with neighborhood crime and blight, with no access to nutritious food and no place for their mom to cash a paycheck, with a job market that needs skills they don't have, with no way to pay for college.\nBut those Orchard Gardens kids should not be left on their own. Those children are America's children too! Yours and mine. \nAnd among them \u2014 among them are the future scientists and entrepreneurs, teachers, artists, engineers, laborers and civic leaders we desperately need. For this country to rise, they must rise. And they and their cause must have a champion in the White House. That champion is Barack Obama. That cause is the American Dream. Let's fight for that. Let's canvas, and phone bank, and get out the vote for that. Let's go tell everyone we meet that when the American Dream is on the line, we want Barack Obama in charge. \nThank you so much. God bless you, and God bless the United States. Thank you. ", "Thank you. Good evening. My name is Lilly Ledbetter, and I'm here tonight to say what a difference four years makes. Some of you may know my story, how for 19 years I worked as the manager at a tire plant in Alabama.\nAnd some of you may have lived a similar story.\nAfter nearly two decades of hard, proud work, I found out that I was making significantly less money than the men who were doing the same work as me. I went home, talked to my husband, and we decided to fight. We decided to fight for our family and for your family too. We sought \u2014 \u2014 justice because equal pay for equal work is an American value.\nThat fight took me 10 years. It took me all the way to the Supreme Court. And in a 5-to-4 decision, they stood on the side of those who shortchanged my pay, my overtime and my retirement just because I'm a woman. The Supreme Court told me that I should have filed a complaint within six months of the company's first decision to pay me less, even though I didn't know about it for nearly two decades.\nAnd if we hadn't elected President Barack Obama, the Supreme Court's wrongheaded interpretation would have been the law of the land. And that would have been the end of my story.\nBut with President Obama on our side, even though I lost before the Supreme Court, we won. \u2014 it says something about his priorities.\nThe first bill he would put his name on has my name on it too. \nThe president signed the bill for his grandmother, whose dreams hit the glass ceiling, and for his daughters so that theirs never will. Because of his leadership, women who faced pay discrimination like I did now can get their day in court.\nThat was the first step, but it can't be the last because women still earn just 77 cents for every dollar men make. Those pennies add up to real money. It's real money for the little things like being able to take your kids to the movies and for the big things like sending them to college. It's paying your rent this month and the mortgage and the future. It's having savings for the bill you didn't expect and savings for the dignified retirement you have earned.\nMaybe 23 cents doesn't sound like a lot to someone with a Swiss bank account, a Cayman Island investment \u2014 \u2014 an IRA worth tens of millions of dollars. But Governor Romney, when we lose 23 cents every hour, every day, every paycheck, every job over the entire lives, we lose just cannot be measured in dollars.\nThree years ago, the House passed the Paycheck Fairness Act to level the playing field for women in America. The Senate Republicans blocked it. Mitt Romney won't even say if he supports it. President Obama does. \nIn the end, I didn't get a dime of money. I was shortchanged. But this fight became bigger than Lilly Ledbetter. Today, it's about my daughter, it's about my granddaughter, it's about women and men. ", "All right, Maya. Hey.Greetings and aloha from the great state of Hawaii. I'm Maya Soetoro-ng, an educator, mother of two and proud to be Barack Obama's little sister.\nI'm Craig Robinson, Michelle Obama's big brother, father of four and head coach of Oregon State University's men's basketball team. \nAny 7-footers out there, give me a call.Craig and I come from different states, we've had different upbringings and, as you can see, we have different perspectives on the world. But no matter how different we may seem, we share a set of values our parents gave us, values the same in Chicago as they are in Honolulu, a willingness to work hard, a commitment to education and the responsibility to look out for each other. They're the values at the core of how Barack and Michelle have lived their lives, raised our nieces and led this country as president and first lady of the United States. Four years ago at this convention I spoke with you all about how Barack and I didn't grow up with much in the way of wealth, but we were blessed with a mother who taught us that education is the surest path from limited means to limitless opportunity. She inspired me to become a teacher, and she inspired Barack's deep commitment to giving all our young people the opportunities our education gave us. He's made sure more of our youngest children have the stable foundation that Head Start provides, he's saved the jobs of teachers in our schools and he's helped more of our students afford a higher education.\nOur mother also taught us that everyone has worth, regardless of who they are or what they believe. That's what inspired Barack's vision for a more inclusive and compassionate America, where everyone has a part to play in our shared story. He's made sure women can fight for equal pay for equal work and stood up for the freedom to make our own decisions about our health. He named two brilliant women who understand our lives to the Supreme Court. \nMaking sure everyone in America has a chance to make it like he did \u2014 that's what my wonderful big brother is all about, and that's what he'll do for four more years. Four years ago I told you how when she was a young girl, Michelle used to talk to me about which kids at school were having a tough time at home and didn't have anybody to stick up for them.\nAnd what inspired her most as she traveled this country on that campaign were the stories of brave Americans who juggle everything at home while their husbands and wives are off at war. You see, America's military spouses and families make profound sacrifices too, and Michelle promised that if she had the privilege to serve as first lady, she'd do everything she could to make sure America was there to honor, recognize and support their unique service. I've been so proud to watch her rally Americans to give millions of hours of their time in service to our military families.\nShe's working with schools that educate military children to add better courses. When Barack challenged businesses to hire 100,000 veterans and military spouses, Michelle and Jill Biden rallied CEOs to the cause. And last month, they stood with CEOs to announce that they've hired 125,000 veterans and military spouses \u2014 \u2014 surpassing the goal more than a year ahead of schedule.\nShe's still the kind little sister she always was. Now she's just sticking up for those who stand up for us. And I'm proud of her work to give our children a healthier start in life. And let's face it, Maya, I could use the recruits. Barack and Michelle have always been there for us. Tonight, we are here for them. And with your help, we can fill the White House with their brand of warmth, compassion and commitment to all our people for four more years. Thank you so much. ", "Hello. Thank you. Thank you, guys. Nice. See, I like that. Thank you very much.\nI am honored to accept your nomination for president of the United States. \nWait. This is not my speech. Prompter guy, can we pull up my speech, please? This is awkward.\nSo while we're waiting, I guess I should have a message, a special message for those of you at home who recently turned 18. Good news. I can now legally register you to vote. \nNow, I've worked on a lot of fun movies, but my favorite job was having a boss who gave the order to take out bin Laden and who's cool with all of us getting gay married. \u2014 and for giving my friends access to affordable health insurance and doubling funding for the Pell grants.\nNow, I started volunteering for Barack Obama back in 2007, but nothing really compares to what I saw behind the scenes at the White House when I had the honor to serve for two years as President Obama's liaison to young Americans. I saw how hard he fights for us.\nAnd one of the most special days was a Saturday in 2012. The Senate had repealed \"don't ask, don't tell\" \u2014 \u2014 so that anyone can serve the country they love regardless of whom they love.\nBut the same day, the Dream Act was blocked. That bill would give immigrant children who've never pledged allegiance to any flag but ours the chance to earn their citizenship. \nAnd I was in a small office on the second floor of the West Wing with about eight other staffers, and we had worked our hearts out \u2014 cared very deeply about what this would mean for other young people. There wasn't a dry eye in the room. Tears of joy for the history that was made, but also tears of sadness because some American dreams would still be deferred.\nAnd about five minutes later, President Obama walked in, sleeves rolled up, and he said to us: This is not over. We're going to keep fighting. I'm going to keep fighting. I need young people to keep fighting. That's why we're here. \nA few months later, President Obama fought to keep taxes from going up on middle-class families. And our Republican friends said, sure, you can do that. But one of the things they were willing to trade is a little item called the college tax credit, which today is saving students up to $10,000 over the course of four years of school. \nPresident Obama paid off his own student loans not too long ago. So he remembers what that's like. And he said that making it easier to go to college and get technical training is exactly how we grow our economy and create jobs, and outcompete the entire world. \nBut here's the thing. Here's the thing. If we don't register, if we don't vote, it won't be. I volunteered in Iowa in 2007 because, like you \u2014 \u2014 I had friends serving in Iraq. I had friends who were looking for jobs. Others who couldn't go to the doctor because they couldn't afford it.\nI felt that had to change. So I knocked on some doors, I registered voters and I'm volunteering again because my friend Matt got a job at a Detroit car company that still exists. And Lauren \nAnd we can't turn back now. So before I close \u2014 and as I wonder which Twitter hashtags you'll start using when I'm done talking \u2014 hashtag sexy face \u2014 \nNow, I really, really enjoyed listening to Rahm's speech, but he's the mayor now so he can't use four-letter words. ", "From 1965 to 1967 my dad, Jack Gilligan, served in Congress and helped pass landmark laws like the Voting Rights Act. Dad later became another great governor of Ohio. \nBut one of his proudest accomplishments was when, as a congressman, he helped to draft and pass Medicare. Today Dad's 91, and he's a happy beneficiary of that effort to bring quality health care to every senior citizen. And President Obama is building on that legacy by building quality and secure health care to every American.\nI was governor of Kansas \u2014 \u2014 because no matter who you are, what stage of life you're in, this law is a good thing.\nFirst, if you already have insurance you like, you can keep it. Insurance companies can no longer refuse to cover Americans with pre- existing conditions. That's what change looks like. More than 5 million seniors have already saved money on their prescription drugs, and almost 33 million have benefited from free preventive services.\nThe president has cracked down hard on Medicare and health care fraud, recovering a record-breaking $10.7 billion over the last three years, protecting our senior citizens. That's what change looks like. \nThis law gives tax credits to 360 small businesses so they can give their employees health coverage, and an array of affordable private insurance plans to choose from. That's what change looks like.\nIf you're self-employed, between jobs or can't get insurance through work, you'll have access to affordable health insurance, as good as Congressman Paul Ryan's. That's what change looks like. \nIf you're under 26, you can stay on your parents' plan. You can go back to school or get extra training without fear of a health catastrophe bankrupting your entire family. Over 3 million previously uninsured young adults are now on their parents' plans. That's what change looks like. \nUnder \"Obamacare,\" insurance companies can no longer discriminate against women. Now before, some wouldn't even cover women's most basic health needs, like contraception and maternity care, but still charged us up to 50 percent more than men for a worse plan. They said women who had c-sections or survived breast cancer or even domestic violence had a pre-existing condition, and would deny them coverage.\nBut this president made it illegal to discriminate against women. And \u2014 \u2014 and ended the practice of insurance companies charging women higher premiums than men for the same coverage. The president ensured women's free access to preventive services like breast cancer screenings.\nSo the good news is, being a mother is no longer a liability and being a woman is no longer a pre-existing condition. Now that's what change looks like.\nToday, nearly 13 million Americans, including some of you in this hall, are experiencing something remarkable. Instead of sending your checks to your insurance companies, your insurance companies are sending a check to you \u2014 over a billion dollars out this year alone. Because if insurers don't spend at least 50 percent of your premium dollars on your health care, you get a refund. That's what change looks like. \nNow, I've spent my career fighting the worst practices of insurance companies. I know how tough it is to stand up to powerful forces that prey on consumers. Governor Romney and Paul Ryan know how tough it is, too. That's why they won't do it. They'll let insurance companies continue to cherry-pick who gets coverage and who gets left out, priced out or locked out of the market.\nPresident Obama is making sure that everyone, from cancer survivors to children with asthma, get the care they need.\nWhat's missing from the Romney-Ryan plan for Medicare is Medicare. So instead of the Medicare guarantee, Republicans would give seniors a voucher that limits what's covered, costing seniors as much as $6,400 more a year.\nPresident Obama extended the program's life by eight years while improving seniors' benefits and strengthening the Medicare guarantee. The president agrees there should be no vouchers. \nRomney and Ryan will take away women's basic health services and turn a blind eye to insurance discrimination. President Obama stands up for women, giving us control over our own health care. Romney and Ryan would put insurance companies back in control.\nNow, Barack Obama was raised by Kansas women. I know Kansas women. They taught him the values of hard work and responsibility and fairness. That's why President Obama believes that if you work and play by the rules, you deserve the security of health care. Governor Romney, Congressman Ryan and their Republican colleagues say it's everyone for themselves.\nAnd that, fundamentally, is the choice in this election, between Republicans who only fight for the favored few or a president who fights for the middle class, between a nation whose politics play on the worst of our fears and a nation whose law reflects the best of our values.\nForty-seven years ago my dad proudly watched President Johnson sign Medicare into law. That day President Johnson said few people have the courage to stake reputation and position and the effort of a lifetime on such a cause when there are so few that share it.\nPresident Obama is one of those people. A leader with uncommon compassion and uncommon courage, he's earned more than our gratitude. He has earned four more years. ", "Hello. I'm Ted Strickland, and I come from Duck Run, Ohio! And let me tell you, folks in Ohio knows what happens when you have a president who stands up for average working people.\nEina Sidney She's an autoworker and a breadwinner once again.\nAs he celebrated the birth of his newborn baby boy, Brian Slagel \nJames Facin He's thrilled to say that his life right now is eat, sleep and Jeep.\n\nLate last year Chrysler announced they were hiring 1,100 new autoworkers in Toledo. \nBefore Barack Obama took office, it looked like that pride could have vanished forever. But today, from the staggering depths of the Great Recession, the nation has had 29 straight months of job growth. \nWorkers across my state and across the country are getting back to work \u2014 the dignity of having a good job and a good salary.\nYou know, Vince Lombardi was right when he said: It's not whether you get knocked down. It's whether you get back up. That's what happens when you have a president who stands up for average working people. \nQuite frankly \u2014 quite frankly, Barack Obama knows what it's like to pay a mortgage and student loans. And he knows what it's like to watch a beloved family member in a medical crisis, and worry that treatment may be out of reach. Barack Obama knows our struggles, and my friends, he shares our values. \nNow, Mitt Romney, he lives by a different code. To him, American workers are just numbers on a spreadsheet. To him, all profits are created equal whether made on our shores or off.\nThat's why companies that Romney invested in were dubbed \"outsourcing pioneers.\" Now, you know our nation was built by pioneers, pioneers who accepted untold risks in pursuit of freedom, not by pioneers seeking offshore profits at the expense of American workers here at home. \nMitt Romney proudly wrote an op-ed entitled, let Detroit go \u2014 Detroit go bankrupt. \nMitt has so little economic patriotism that even his money needs a passport. It's summers on the beaches of the Cayman Islands and winters on the slopes of the Swiss Alps. \nIn Matthew \u2014 in Matthew, Chapter 6, Verse 21, the Scriptures teach us that where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. And my friends, my friends, any man who aspires to be our president should keep both his treasure and his heart in the United States of America.\n\u2014 it's well past time for Mitt Romney to come clean with the American people \u2014\u2014 on what he's saying about the president's policies for welfare to work. He's lying, as simple as that. \nAnd on his tax returns, he's hiding. \nAnd so, my friends, there is a true choice in this election. Barack Obama is betting on the American worker. Mitt Romney is betting on a Bermuda shell corporation. \nMy friends, the stakes are too high, the differences too stark to sit this one out.\nSo let us stand as one on November the 6th and move this country forward by re-electing President Barack Obama. \nThank you. ", "Governor Romney says people like me were the most excited about President Obama the day we voted for him. But that's not true, not even close.\nFor me, there was the day the Affordable Care Act passed and I no longer had to worry about getting Zoe the care she needed. Like so many moms with sick children, I shed tears, and I could breathe easier.\nKnowing we have that net below us to catch us if we fall or if, God forbid, Zoe needs a heart transplant, \"Obamacare\" provides my family security and relief.\n\nBut we're also scared. Governor Romney repealing health care reform is something we worry about literally every single day. Zoe's third open-heart surgery will happen either next year or the year after. If Mitt Romney becomes president and \"Obamacare\" is repealed, there is a good chance she'll hit her lifetime cap. There is no way we could afford to pay for all the care she needs to survive. When you have a sick child, it's always in the back of your mind and sometimes in the front of your mind. On top of that, worrying that people would let an insurance company take away her health care just because of politics.\nOne-in-100 children are born with a congenital heart defect. President Obama is fighting for them. ", "Good evening, and thank you for having me here to celebrate with all of you.\nAs the nation's only independent governor, I'm here tonight to join with my Democratic friends \u2014 \u2014 on the eve of an election critical to the future of our children and their country.\nAs a former Republican, I represent a group of Americans who all too often have no one to speak for them.\nThis group doesn't necessarily have a name. We've been called \"moderates.\" But that term can be misleading. There's nothing moderate about our love of country or our passion for America's future. There's nothing moderate about our desire to work together within the broad political center in which most Americans live.\nNo matter what you call us, though, this is certain: There are a lot of us, and all over the country, and in November we will once again help elect Barack Obama president of the United States. \nWe are, at our core, conservatives, in the best sense of the word: thoughtful, responsible with public resources and respectful of personal freedom. And we are liberal in the best sense of the word. We believe that government can and should be an instrument for the greater good. And although my former party has hijacked the term, there's really nothing conservative about today's Republican Party. \nFirst, we love this land, literally. We believe in environmental stewardship, protecting our air and our water \u2014 \u2014 because despite what big business and this Republican Party would have you believe, destroying these precious resources will cost us far more in the future than preserving them now.\n\nSecond, we believe in personal freedom. We do not want the government controlling our personal lives or our most personal decisions. Believing in freedom as we do, we don't think it's the role of government to pass judgment on a relationship between two consenting adults regardless of their orientation. \nThird, we take seriously the decision to enter into foreign entanglements. During the last administration, then-Senator Obama and I served together on the Foreign Relations Committee. There we shared a mutual desire to end the prevailing attitude of arrogance and recklessness on matters of war and peace that characterized those years. President Obama, he knows that wars are not to be entered into lightly. He knows that overseas conflict don't only do damage in the land in which they are fought, but in the land of those who fight them as well.\nFourth, we believe in using the tools of government to help Americans help themselves. For instance, programs such as Head Start and Pell Grants have brightened the futures of countless American young people \u2014 \u2014 and given them a hand up into the middle class. Now Mitt Romney and the Republicans are proposing a budget that would squeeze the life out of Head Start and Pell Grants. Let me ask you, should only the children of the wealthy have access to early education?Should only the children of the wealthy have access to a college degree?No. The answer is absolutely no. American education is still the wonder of the world, and we must open the schoolhouse doors, not close them. A strong educated middle class \u2014 \nFinally, we believe in fiscal responsibility. We think it's reasonable to pay for a valuable service that the people want by asking everyone to do their part. The lack of fiscal responsibility is one of the main reasons I finally left my old party. In \u2014 \u2014 that's right. That's right.\nIn 2001 President Bill Clinton handed the Republicans a surplus, and they went on to squander that surplus by launching two wars, expanding the cost of Medicare and giving tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, and failing to pay for any of these.\nMitt Romney and Paul Ryan want to return us to the fantasy land of never having to pay for things we buy, such as education, medical research, good roads and clean energy. That's not conservative, that's not responsible, and that's not what this country needs. \nThe values I have spoken of tonight aren't Republican or Democratic values. They're American values. They're the values of Abraham Lincoln, who affirmed the fundamental dignity of all Americans regardless of the color of their skin.\nThey're the values of Theodore Roosevelt, who protected millions of acres from development and exploitation so that future Americans, today's Americans, could enjoy them as fully as he did.\nThese are the values of Dwight Eisenhower, who presided over an era of peace and prosperity, because he knew that those two conditions go together. These are American values. But because they have no place in today's Republican Party, neither do I, and neither do millions like me. \nBut my \u2014 ", "Hi, everyone. My name is Tammy Duckworth. I'm running to serve Illinois' 8th Congressional District. \nMy father \u2014 my father served in the Army and the Marine Corps. Ooh-rah.A Vietnam vet, his family has worn our nation's uniform since the American Revolution.\nMy husband is an Army officer, and my brother saved lives in the Coast Guard. My mom is Thai and Chinese, and she proudly became a citizen in her 50s. \nDad's work \u2014 Dad's work took us all over the world until he lost his job. It was a tough time. We used up our savings, moved into a studio apartment. But our family did the responsible thing, and we rolled up our sleeves. Mom took in sewing. My 55-year-old dad kept looking for work. But at 15 years old, I was the only one with a job, after school, for minimum wage. Thank God for the food stamps, public education and Pell Grants that helped me finish high school and college. \nIn time, we pulled through. With this start, I was able to earn my own commission as an Army officer, and I became an Assault Helicopter pilot, working my way up to command a Black Hawk helicopter company. \u2014 almost a year into my tour, I was wounded and recovered at Walter Reed with other wounded warriors. Some of us had obvious injuries; others had scars on the inside that were less visible but no less real.\nAt the hospital, I realized my new responsibility: to honor the buddies who saved me by serving our military men and women. And I became the director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. \nWe led the nation \u2014 we led the nation in screening for traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress, and we created a tax credit for Illinois businesses that hire veterans.\nThen, President Obama asked me to help keep our sacred trust with veterans of all eras at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. We work to end the outrage of veterans having to sleep on the same streets they once defended. We improved services for female veterans, and I reached out to young vets by creating the Office of Online Communications.\nBarack Obama has also lived up to his responsibilities as commander in chief: ending the war in Iraq, refocusing on Afghanistan and eradicating terrorist leaders, including bin Laden. \nPresident Obama pushed for fairness in the military, listening to commanders as we ended \"don't ask, don't tell\" \u2014 \nWhen it comes to our men and women in harm's way, we have a clear choice on November 6th.\nLast week Mitt Romney had a chance to show his support for the brave men and women he is seeking to command. But he chose to criticize President Obama instead of even uttering the word \"Afghanistan.\" Barack Obama will never ignore our troops. He will fight for them. That's why he is my choice on November 6th.\nMy choice \u2014 \u2014 my choice is to do what my family did when times were hard: roll up our sleeves and get to work. My choice is to do what my crew did for me in a dusty field in Iraq. On November 12th, 2004, I was co-piloting my Black Hawk north of Baghdad when we started taking enemy fire. A rocket-propelled grenade hit our helicopter, exploding in my lap, ripping off one leg, crushing the other and tearing my right arm apart. But I kept trying to fly until I passed out. And in that moment, my survival and the survival of my entire crew depended on all of us pulling together. And even though they were wounded themselves and insurgents were nearby, they simply refused to leave a fallen comrade behind. Their heroism is why I'm alive today.\nAnd ultimately \u2014 \u2014\u2014 building an economy that will create jobs here at home, that will \u2014 and outcompete countries around the world.\nBut it's also about something else. It's about whether we do for our fellow Americans what my crew did for me, whether we'll look out for the hardest-hit and the disabled, whether we'll pull together in a time of need, whether we'll refuse to give up until the job is done.\nSo let's finish what we started. Let's keep moving forward with Barack Obama. Let's do what this country has always done \u2014 ", "Hello, delegates. \u2014 and our 1 million member activists, I am honored to be here to talk to you about what is at stake for women in 2012.\nI am proud to say that the Democratic Party believes that women have the right to choose a safe, legal abortion with dignity and with privacy. \nWe are proud \u2014 we are so proud to have a president who stands with women and who trusts women \u2014 \nI know this president, and I can tell you that he cares deeply about the next generation of young women in this country, his daughters, all of our daughters.\nPresident Obama had the courage to stand with Sandra Fluke. \nWe cannot trust Mitt Romney to protect our health. He would repeal \"Obamacare,\" taking away our access to better maternity and prenatal care and the law's near-universal coverage of birth control.\nWe cannot trust Mitt Romney to respect our rights. He would overturn Roe versus Wade and sign into law a wave of outrageous restrictions on a woman's ability to make decisions about her pregnancy.\nMitt Romney would take away our power to make decisions about our lives and our future.\nBut there is one decision that he cannot take away \u2014 \nI want to leave you with a story tonight, one that serves as my inspiration. I grew up in Anaconda, Montana. It is in the heart of the state's mining country. My dad worked at the copper smelter. It was a tough and dangerous place where copper would boil at 1,200 degrees. He had a brass peg and on it was his number \u2014 720. Workers like my dad would throw their number in a bucket as they arrived for their shift, and at the end of the day they would hang it on a pegboard so their buddies would know they made it out safely.\nEvery day my dad threw that peg in that bucket, he did it for his family. He did it for his \nHe passed away \u2014 he passed away when I was in my 20s, before I decided to run for public office. This number symbolizes the value of hard work and opportunity and the importance of sticking together.\nWe are ready to do the hard work. We are ready to work together. We are ready to re-elect President Barack Obama. We must \u2014 we must do it because women deserve to make their own choices and deserve to determine the course of their own lives.\nNow, I got to tell you, don't assume that every voter knows what Barack Obama has done for the women in this country, and don't assume that they know the truth about Mitt Romney.\nTonight I'm asking you to talk with your friends, your neighbors, your relatives, even the ones you have never talked to, about reproductive rights. That's how you can throw your Conversation by conversation, vote by vote, door by door, we will re-elect President Barack Obama.\nI will see you on the campaign trail.\nThank you very much. ", "My name is Maria Ciano. I grew up in a conservative Republican family in Aurora, Colorado. Many of my relatives can't believe I'm doing this. I guess I can't either. \nI still believe in small government, but I no longer believe in the Republican Party. \nMitt Romney and Paul Ryan want the government to have a say in my family planning. They want employers to decide what kind of birth control coverage I have or if I can have it at all. They want to put insurance companies in charge of my health care. They want to deny me the power to make the most personal decisions about my life. That's not small government. That's not the America I love. \nThe America I love respects the dignity of women. The America I love is a place where when we say freedom, we mean my freedom to make decisions about my life, not someone else's freedom to make them for me. \nAnd that's the America President Obama is fighting for. When women's rights are threatened, President Obama doesn't hide. He stands up not just for women but with women \u2014 \u2014 amplifying our voices and defending our rights.\nGive him four more years, and our right to make our own most personal decisions will be safe for another generation. Give him four more years, and he will protect the freedoms in America we all love.\nThank you. ", "My name is Jared Polis. My great-grandparents were immigrants to this country. I'm Jewish, I'm gay, I'm a father, I'm a son, I'm an entrepreneur, and I'm a congressman from the great state of Colorado. \nBut first and foremost, first and foremost, I'm an American. And the America that I believe in is the America Barack Obama believes in. It's the America you believe in, one where if you play by the rules and work hard, you can get ahead and succeed and live the American dream, one in which loving families of all forms are respected and celebrated as the backbone of society, one in which today's divisions become tomorrow's unity, in which we transcend partisan bickering and work together to forge a better future for ourselves and our families.\nDiversity is America's strength, and only by working together as one nation can we form a more perfect union. That's why President Obama brought to Washington a vision for one America \u2014 an America in which we can overcome divisions of red and blue to make our country better.\nIt's why he's fighting to make citizenship a reality for young immigrants who go to college and serve in our military. \nIt's why he repealed \"don't ask, don't tell\" so that no person is prevented from serving the country they love because of who they love. \nAnd it's why Barack Obama because the first sitting president in American history to show his personal support for same-sex marriage. \nConsistently over the last four years, as our nation has struggled through the worst depression since the \u2014 worst recession since the Great Depression, Barack Obama has shown strong leadership. And he's taken on politics as usual. He's challenged our nation to come together.\nBarack Obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse contributions from lobbyists. He set the strictest ethics rules in the history of the executive branch. His vision for one America, one in which we can overcome our divisions to make our country greater, continues to be an enormous challenge to Washington, D.C., a town professional pundits and polls, whose entire livelihood is never-ended partisan bickering.\nBut ladies and gentlemen, now is our chance to tell the dividers no. To tell the special interests and cynical Washington insiders no, to tell the lobbyists and PACs no. And to tell our fellow countrymen and countrywomen, gay and straight, Christians, Jews, Mormons, Muslims and nonbelievers, rich and poor, black and white, Latino and Asian, east and west, north and south \u2014 it's time to tell them yes.\nTogether, together we are stronger. Together, we are better. Together, we are America. And that's why we must continue bringing America together.\nSo tonight I don't just ask my fellow Americans to respect my relationship with my partner, Marlon, and my role as a father to our son. I also ask my fellow Americans to respect a Christian family concerned about decaying moral values and crass commercialism. I ask my fellow Americans to respect the very difficult decision of a single mother to bring a child into this world because of her heartfelt beliefs. And that's why we must help that courageous mother have the support she needs after her child is born. \nWe celebrate Americans of all backgrounds and beliefs, even Republicans, because it's their future too. Republicans might have mocked our desire to heal the planet, but we will heal it for Republicans too, and we'll create jobs and improve our schools for Republicans too. We're a diverse country, but we are one country, and we're at our best when we come together as Americans not despite our differences but in celebration of them. From our newest arrivals to our Native American brothers and sisters, we are one America.\nBarack Obama understands that together, we can take on any challenge, and together, we can move our country forward. Out of many, we are one. God bless America. ", "Thank you, Florida. Four years ago I stood at the convention podium in Denver, affirming Barack Obama's heartfelt, steadfast commitment to the state of Israel.\nOver the past four years the president has proven this commitment time and again in both word and deed. And the Democratic Party platform reflects the president's unflinching commitment to Israel's security and future as a Jewish state. \nTo strengthen Israel's qualitative military advantage, the president has increased security assistance to Israel to record levels, more than any other president. When he visited Sderot in 2008, an Israeli town along the Gaza border besieged by constant rocket attacks, President Obama saw for himself the terrible toll terrorism takes on Israelis. And that's why he secured the funds to deploy the Iron Dome anti-rocket defense system, which has already saved countless Israeli lives.\nAnd under President Obama, the U.S. and Israel are firmly committed to stopping one of the gravest threats to international security, Iran's quest for nuclear weapons. The president has explicitly stated that an Iranian nuclear weapon is unacceptable and that he will mobilize all instruments of U.S. power, economic, diplomatic, intelligence and military to prevent, not contain, a nuclear Iran.\nDue to the president's strong leadership, Iran is more isolated than ever. He has marshaled the international community to impose the most crippling sanctions in history. Iran's oil exports have plummeted, and its currency value has been slashed in half.\nNot only has he stood up to Iran, President Obama has also bravely stood up for Israel in the international community. In the wake of the Gaza flotilla, President Obama's support for Israel never waned.\nNow the president's opponents have been busy distorting his record. Last week Mitt Romney claimed that the president has thrown Israel under the bus. Perhaps Mr. Romney should listen to those who know best, Israel's leaders. Listen to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who thanked President Obama for unprecedented security cooperation and for wearing his support for the Jewish state as a badge of honor. Listen to Defense Minister Ehud Barak, who has repeatedly declared that President Obama has done more for Israeli security than any U.S. president he can remember. \nAnd listen to Israel's beloved president, Shimon Peres, who recently said: Mr. President, you have pledged a lasting friendship for Israel. You stated that Israel's security is sacrosanct for you. So you pledged, so you act, so you are acting as a great leader, as a genuine friend.\nNow is the time \u2014 now is the time to continue the strong U.S.- Israel relationship. Now is the time to stand with Israel as it works towards peace and security, toward two states, a secure Israel living side by side with an independent, nonmilitarized Palestinian state. Now is the time to support Israel as a thriving, democratic and secure homeland for the Jewish people by re-electing Barack Obama as president of the United States. Thank you very much.", "Thank you. Good evening, delegates.\nThis is the first convention since 1956 that we meet without Senator Kennedy. But make no mistake: He is here with us this evening. I see him in the passion of our delegates, the character of our candidates and the causes that unite us.\nFor my uncle Teddy, politics was always about people. He was from a big family, and he understood that lives are measured not by line items and a budget but by first days of school, last days of summer, by promotions won and jobs lost, new homes, broken hearts, baptisms, funerals and every precious moment in between.\nI remember campaigning with him once in Texas for then-Senator Barack Obama. We showed up at a hall in a small border town with only a handful of voters to greet us.\nHe didn't care. They were working folks who had come out to support our candidate. Uncle Teddy got up, raised his hands and belted out \"Ay, Jalisco, no te rajes!\" in a strong Boston accent. The crowd went crazy for the old ranchero song and the Massachusetts mariachi who sang it.\nIt was Uncle Teddy at his best. And he gave his best to everyone he met, whether a sick child, and injured soldier, an unemployed worker. That idea guided him through the bigger battles: to guarantee the right to organize, to end apartheid, bring peace to Northern Ireland and health care to all. \nIt guides us \u2014 and it guides us in the tough campaign ahead as we fight for our middle class and an economy that's built to last, defend a woman's right to choose, keep a college education affordable, protect our seniors' retirement security and ask every American to do their part to safeguard the promise of this country.\nFour years ago Uncle Teddy marveled at the grit and grace of a young senator who embodied the change our country sorely needed. As we pause today to remember Senator Kennedy, we recommit ourselves to the leader he entrusted to carry on our cause.\nThank you very much. ", "Good evening. I'm Ken Salazar \u2014 \nMy support for Barack Obama is deeply rooted in the American dream. We have both been blessed by this great nation. I'm a 12th- generation Mexican-American. \nLikewise, Barack Obama's grandparents were from the neighboring state, the Great Plains of the state of Kansas. His grandfather marched for the cause of freedom in Patton's army. And his grandmother worked in the factories during the war. And he was raised by those grandparents and a courageous mother, who instilled their values in him and taught him that there were no limits to what he could achieve.\nBarack Obama was not born into wealth or privilege, yet today he is president of these United States of America. \nNow, on the other side, Mitt Romney, he just doesn't get it. He hasn't walked in the shoes of most Americans, and he doesn't understand that we should focus on helping those around America's kitchen tables, not just those around the boardrooms of America. We \u2014 we need a president who is on our side.\nMy father used to tell me, \"Dime con quien andas, y te dire quien eres\" \u2014 tell me who you are \u2014 who you walk with, and I'll tell you who you are.\nBarack Obama walks with us. I've watched President Obama protect America's land, water and wildlife. To honor all our cultures; to uphold our commitments to tribal nations and to secure America's energy future.\nIn an era when America's working so hard to achieve energy independence, the president's mission has never been more important. It was President Nixon who first talked about the term \"energy independence.\" Yet, until President Obama took charge, no president had been so successful in helping America make real strides towards a secure and independent energy future. \nWhat did the old \"drill, baby, drill\" of the last Republican administration get us? And now where would the same Ramen -Ryan \"drill, baby, drill\" approach take us?\nFour years ago, America imported nearly 60 percent of its oil. President Obama recognized that that path was unsustainable and dangerous. Under President Obama's leadership, the United States moved forward with an all-of-the-above energy strategy. Oil and gas, nuclear, hydro, biofuels, wind, geothermal, solar \u2014 all of it. All of it. \nAnd today, for the first time in more than a decade \u2014 for the first time in more than a decade \u2014 we import less than half our oil. U.S. natural gas production is at an all-time high, and oil production at a 14-year high.\nRenewable energy from solar and wind has more than doubled under the president's leadership. \nAnd thanks to President Obama's leadership, the auto industry is making cars that Americans want to buy, that get better gas mileage, that save money at the pump and reduce emissions. \nToday, America's dependence on foreign oil is at its lowest point in two decades. The Romney-Ryan plan calls this success imaginary. They say renewable energy is a fad. They even had the gall last week, as the hurricane lashed our coast, to mock our sacred responsibility as stewards of God's earth. Their attitude isn't just sad, it's reckless and it's backwards. And yes, they're still locked in an ideological embrace with the failed policies of the past.\nPresident Obama's energy program is the real deal. It moves us forward, not backward, forward to fuel-efficient cars, a healthy auto industry and good middle-class jobs, forward to a healthier planet and forward to the new energy frontier and American energy independence.\nOn November 6th, America faces a choice: return to the Romney- Ryan ticket of failed policies of the past, or move ahead with a smart, focused and determined president who understands that America always does best when it harnesses the winds of innovation and change.\nFor the sake of every American family, for the sake of American energy independence, for the sake of America's best future, let's go forward, not backward. Let's walk with the president who walks with us \u2014 who walks with us, our great president, Barack Obama. ", "Thirty-six years ago, on our nation's bicentennial, I accepted your nomination as president of the United States. I said then that America needed a president who shares your dreams and takes his strength and wisdom from you, the American people.\nLadies and gentlemen, both now and for the next four years we have just such a leader in the White House.\nSomething you realize quickly in the Oval Office is that the easy decisions are not the ones that make their way to your desk. Whether they are issues of war and peace or great economic matters, be they popular or unpopular, only a president can make those most difficult choices. In those moments, it takes more than a grasp of policy. It takes integrity and an understanding of why and whom you serve. From President Obama's first day in office, I've watched him, as I know you have, face these tough decisions and always put the interest of middle-class Americans above those who, often with a larger wallet, have an ever-louder voice. I've admired him for that.\nBecause President Obama sits behind that desk, everyday people from Plains, Georgia, to Pittsburgh, have someone who's on their side, thinking about them, working to give them an equal chance in life. In just four short years, he has worked to avert economic calamity, brought a dignified end to the ill-conceived war in Iraq and signed into law historic health care reform \u2014 a dream that was already decades overdue when I called for it at this convention 36 years ago. And he has done it all in the face of bitter, unyielding, in fact unprecedented partisan opposition.\nOverseas, President Obama has restored the reputation of the United States within the world community. Dialogue and collaboration are once again possible, with the return of a spirit of trust and goodwill to our foreign policy.\nOf course, there remains much to do. In communities across America and in countries around the world, life is too hard for too many people. We see their struggles, and our hearts go out to them. And in the coming years our hands must continue to reach out to them.\nYet for all that remains to be done, at home and abroad, the evidence is overwhelming: President Obama is a leader for America as we face the onslaught of some of the most complicated domestic and international challenges to confront any U.S. president in modern times.\nIt's up to all of us to make sure that the American people understand exactly what is at stake and at risk in this election. With President Obama in the Oval Office, we can make good progress toward becoming a fairer, stronger, more prosperous and inclusive America, a nation adjusted to changing and challenging times while holding true to unchanging principles, a leader among the community of nations.\nNext month, God willing, I will enter the 88th year of my life. And one month later Rosalynn and I will enter a voting booth in our hometown of Plains and cast another vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden. We will do so with the confidence and conviction that they understand the challenges and difficult choices that face our nation and our people \u2014 in fact, all peoples of the world in the years ahead.\nOne thing I have learned over my lifetime as a submarine officer, as president and as a leader of the Carter Center is that the biggest challenges and problems that we face don't lend themselves to quick fixes nor to the snappy rhetoric of a television commercial. Solutions are complex and difficult, requiring the judgment, skill and patience to pursue the right policies for the right reasons.\nThere's a clear choice facing voters this November. And I am confident that when the facts and policies have been examined and the record of performances have been reviewed, Barack Obama and Joe Biden will once again be elected to lead our beloved country to a better future.\nThank you. ", "Good evening. Good evening. I'm Nancy Pelosi, but my \u2014 \u2014 but my grandchildren call me Mimi.\nFor me, politics is an extension of my role as a mother and as a grandmother.\nFor the Democratic women of the House, our work is not about the next election but rather the next generation. Working with President Barack Obama, we are committed to reigniting the American dream, the ideal that if you're willing to work hard, play by the rules and take responsibility, you will have the opportunity to climb the ladder of success.\nThe Democratic women of the House are ready to join President Barack Obama to move America forward. I'm Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut. And we have work to do.\nAmerica's women still make just 77 cents for every dollar men earn. And it is even tougher for women of color. Those pennies add up to a real difference to middle-class families who are trying to pay their bills, trying to get ahead and trying to achieve the American dream.\nAnd we are making progress. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, to give \u2014 \u2014 real protection to ensure equal pay for equal work.\nThe Democratic women of the House are committed to closing the wage gap for America's families and to move America forward.\nI'm Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney from the great, great state of New York. \nWhen President Obama made health care a right, not a privilege for all Americans, that was the change that brought hope to millions. Now, women are beginning to get the preventive services that they deserve \u2014 including birth control. \nIf they get sick or become pregnant, they will not lose their health insurance. \nAnd soon, for the very first time, no longer will being a woman be a pre-existing medical condition. \nHealthy moms mean healthy families. When my Republican colleagues held a hearing about birth control and refused \u2014 refused \u2014 to include one single woman on the first panel as a witness to speak for the concerns of women, I asked: Where are the women?Where are the women? Where are the women?\n\nWhere are the women? Where are they? \nWe're here!\n\nNow the women of America are here, and we are on our way to re-elect our president, President Barack Obama! Yeah! \u2014 our president!\nThe Democratic women of the House are committed to women's health and to moving America forward with President Obama. Thank you. I'm Congresswoman Allyson Schwartz of the great commonwealth of Pennsylvania! \nMoving America forward means never going backward on America's great promise of health care for our seniors, Medicare. As a daughter who cared for an elderly parent, I know medical care is not optional for our seniors. And we will not let the Republicans end the guarantee of Medicare, which will cost seniors thousands of dollars and endanger the health and retirement security of millions of Americans.\nAmericans have worked for their Medicare. They've paid for their Medicare. And whether you are 65 or 55 or 45 or 35, you have earned your Medicare. \nAmericans deserve the security Medicare provides. President Obama will strengthen and protect Medicare. He already has. And Democrats will make the tough choices, the right choices, to reduce the deficit and preserve Medicare for this generation and for the next.\nThe Democratic women of the House know that a secure retirement moves America forward. I'm Congresswoman Gwen Moore of Wisconsin. I'm the mother of three and the grandmother of three granddaughters.\nFor our daughters and our granddaughters, I'm working hard to end violence against women. \nVice President Biden wrote the Violence Against Women Act, and he and President Obama and Democrats are standing strong to prevent violence for all, whether you were born on a reservation or in another country and whether you love a man or a woman. The Democratic women of the House will fight violence against all Americans to move America forward.\nI'm Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez from the great state of New York. \nWomen in business are helping lead the way for America's economic recovery. Nearly 8 million American women own small businesses, the engines of job creation and the backbone of the American economy. And in these tough economic times, they need a level playing field and a fair shot to get ahead.\nSupporting small businesses means expanding access to credit and supporting investment that will help them grow. Working with President Barack Obama, House Democrats gave entrepreneurial Americans the freedom to pursue their passions, success and the American dream.\nThe Democratic women of the House know that when women succeed in our economy, we move America forward. Aloha! \nWhen I stepped down from the state legislature where I served and headed to a war zone, I joined a long, proud line of Americans who sacrifice to make us the land of the free and the home of the brave. As a combat veteran, I know the cost of war. The sacrifices made by our troops and military families are immeasurable.\nThese days it's often women in uniform: moms, wives, even grandmothers who deploy and leave their families behind. Such heroes and patriots need and deserve leaders who truly understand and care about their hardships and will fight for them. Leaders like President and Michelle Obama and Vice President and Dr. Biden, the strongest advocates our military families could ever have. \nThe Democratic women of the House standing here will honor the service and sacrifice of our troops to move America forward. Aloha; mahalo. I'm Joyce Beatty, and I'm running for Congress from the great state of Ohio to move America forward. \nMoving America forward means higher education that's affordable and prepares our young people to lead in the 21st century economy.\nMoving America forward means affordable health care and equal pay for equal work. \nAnd to unleash the power of moms in the economy, it means affordable, quality child care. \nWe will move America forward on behalf of you, your families and communities, your aspirations. Your hopes for your children. That's because America's success is dependent on the success of women: women in education; women in business; women in military and public service.\nWomen will lead us to victory for strong Democratic majorities in Congress \u2014 \nThe Democratic women of the House are ready to move forward. ", "I'm majority leader of the United States Senate and a senator from Searchlight, Nevada. \nSome said he shouldn't save Detroit, but President Obama made the tough and right call to save more than a million American jobs in an important, iconic industry. Some said he shouldn't move heaven and earth to get bin Laden, but President Obama made the tough and right call to bring the worst terrorist in the world to justice.\n\nSome even said he couldn't take on the big banks that brought our economy to its knees. But President Obama made the tough and right call so taxpayers will never again be on the hook for Wall Street's risky bets. \nSome said he couldn't take on the insurance companies that were ripping us off. But President Obama made the tough and right call to save lives, save Medicare and ensure that no one goes broke just because they get sick. \nHis whole life, there have been so many who told him what he shouldn't or couldn't do. But America has a president who knows what we must do.\nPresident Obama has also faced down another group of naysayers. In addition to the crowd of the \"couldn'ts\" and \"shouldn'ts\", the Republican Party has become the party of the \"wouldn'ts\" and the \"won'ts.\" They wouldn't cooperate to create jobs. They wouldn't try to turn around the economy. They wouldn't do anything but stand in the way of President Obama.\nNow, I've had a front row seat to watch the tea party take over the Republican Party. \nWe must stop the tea party before the United States Senate falls into the hands of extremists and ideologues who leave no room for reason or compromise; who don't recognize common ground even when they're standing it. \nAnd if they won't stand up to Rush Limbaugh or Grover Norquist, what would make anyone think they would stand up for you? \nYou see, today's Republican Party believes in two sets of rules: one for millionaires and billionaires, and another for the middle class. And this year, they've nominated the strongest proponent and clearest beneficiary of this rigged game: Mitt Romney. \nNever in modern American history tried so hard to hide himself from the people he hopes to serve. When you look at the one tax return he has released, it's obvious why. It's obvious why there's only been one. We learned that he pays a lower tax rate than middle- class families. We learned he chose Swiss bank accounts and Cayman Island tax shelters over American institutions. \nAnd we can only imagine what new secrets would be revealed if he showed the American people a dozen years of tax returns, like his father did. \nMitt Romney says we should take his word that he paid his fair share. His word? His word? Trust comes from transparency, and Mitt Romney comes up short on both. \nYou see, this is about more than just a piece of paper. It isn't personal. This is about leveling with the American people and creating a level playing field for them. If we don't know how Mitt Romney would benefit from the policies he proposes, how can we know if he's looking out for us or just himself?\nThe American people are still asking, who is Mitt Romney? But the American people know Barack Obama. \nThis nation has been through hard times, but those hard times have hardened our resolve. I'm ready to do the difficult work that's ahead, but I want to do that work with Barack Obama and not a tea party ideologue. \nWe can move America forward, but we can only do it together. We can move America forward with a strong middle class. We can move America forward with a strong Democratic majority in the Senate. And together, we can move America forward with Barack Obama in the White House. ", "Welcome. Welcome to the Democratic National Convention in 2012 in Charlotte, North Carolina. \nWe have always been that kind of city. Nearly half a century ago, when cities across the South struggled to desegregate schools, Charlotteans came together. Across kitchen tables, black and white families met and decided together to break down barriers that had so long divided their children. And because they did, they gave a generation of kids a chance to go to school together, to learn together, to recognize that there is no wall too high or too strong to be broken down if we do it together. \nI was one of those children. I learned what it truly meant to be judged by the content of one's character.\nI was born to a single mom and raised by her and my grandparents. They taught me to take pride in hard work, to take responsibility for my actions, to understand that an education could expand my mind and transform my life. And so from West Charlotte High School to Davidson College, where I was the first black student body president, from NYU Law School to practicing law in the public and private sectors, from the Charlotte City Council to becoming the first Democratic mayor in Charlotte in 22 years to this stage tonight \u2014 \nAnd you know what? You know what? I've seen President Obama at work, and these are his values too. This is a man who pulled our economy back from the brink. This is a president who plans to give every child an opportunity to succeed. This is a leader who believes all Americans have a fair shot to go as far as their talents can take them. And so Charlotte, North Carolina, America \u2014 \u2014 when this convention ends on Thursday, our work does not. Over the next 62 days, from this night until election night, we will come together as we have so many times before. We will knock on doors. We will register voters. We will stand up for a leader who will move this country forward, and together, we will re-elect President Barack Obama.\nThank you, and God bless you. ", "Good evening. It is so great to be here tonight. Charlotte's doing a great job, and I especially want to give thanks to my friends from Virginia. \nYou know, a few years ago very few imagined that Virginia would be a battleground state. Virginia had last voted for a Democrat for president in 1964. But in 2008 we proudly cast our electoral votes for President Obama. \nIn 2006 and in 2008 we elected two outstanding senators, Jim Webb and Mark Warner. And if I have anything to do with it, we'll win again in 2012.\nHow did Virginia go from red to purple? We did with grassroots excitement and hard work, and we showed Virginians that Democrats get results. When I was governor during the worst recession since the Great Depression, Virginia maintained one of the lowest unemployment rates in America.\nWe kept our AAA bond rating. We were named the most business-friendly state, best-managed state, best state to raise a child. In Virginia, we cut billions from the state government while making critical investments in schools, roads and bridges. We worked together with Democrats, Republicans and independents to get results.\nNow, over the last four years, the GOP pushed ideology and wedge issues. Just last week, they passed a platform demanding privacy for super PACs and denying privacy to women making health care decisions. \nMeanwhile, Democrats fought for the middle class. We cut taxes for 95 percent of American families. \nBut we know we've got more to do. And this fall, there is a real choice. The other side fights to protect subsidies for Big Oil, but we want to invest in America's small businesses. They want bigger tax cuts for those who need it the least. We want to invest in our communities, roads, bridges, infrastructure that will make us more competitive. They want to slash education and training. We want to invest in our future. \nNow, there's just as stark a choice when it comes to fixing America's budget. Remember the last time they were in charge, the other side turned a record surplus into a massive deficit with two wars, trillions in tax breaks, loopholes and entitlements, none of which they would pay for.\nAnd today, well, you see what they're pushing. They're pushing budget-busting tax cuts and economy-busting spending cuts. To pay for the plan, they'd raise taxes on the middle class. They'd turn Medicare into a voucher system. And rather than raise taxes on the wealthy by even one penny, they'd put thousands of defense jobs at risk. So let's be clear: that's not fiscally responsible, that's fiscally reckless, and we can't afford to try it again. \nWe've got to move forward, because while we've made progress, we still have a long way to go. And we'll only get there if we elect leaders who put results over ideology. I support President Obama because he's that kind of a leader. He said he'd go after al-Qaida and he'd take out bin Laden, and with our great SEAL team, that exactly what he did.\n\nHe said \u2014 he said he'd try something that Teddy Roosevelt first talked about, reforming health care system, and he did. \nHe promised \u2014 he promised to fight for equal pay for women, college affordability for students, fair treatment for LGBT Americans, and he's kept his word. \nOur president, President Obama, is a tough leader who gets results for the American public. \nNow, next week \u2014 next week we commemorate the 11th anniversary of 9/11. Many Virginians \u2014 too many Virginians \u2014 lost their lives at the Pentagon on 9/11 and in the wars that we've fought since. When I was governor, I went to the funerals of our Virginia Guard members. I know people who lost their kids, and I know service members who returned with their lives changed forever.\nTheir sacrifice reminds us, we're not Democrats or Republicans first. We're Americans first. \nSo we've been through tough times.We've been through tough times as a nation, but we are tough people. And remember, folks, tough times don't last but tough people do last. \nSo let's come together. Let's come together and show how tough Americans are, and prove that our best days will always, always be ahead of us.\nThanks, and have a great night. Appreciate it. ", "Hello. My name is Doug Stern. I'm an Ohio fireman, and an unlikely choice to be addressing you this evening because for the vast majority of my voting life, I've been a Republican. \nSo why am I here?\nWell, something's happened recently. The Republican Party left people like me. As a member of the middle class, they left me, and they've certainly left me as a public employee. Somewhere \u2014 . Somewhere along the way, being a public employee, someone who works for my community, made me a scapegoat for the GOP.\nVice President Biden and President Obama still believe public service is an honorable calling. \nWhen I go to work \u2014 when there is an emergency \u2014 I want someone on my crew that has my back. Someone who helps me get the job done. Someone who's willing to go through hell with me. And I expect the same out of my elected leaders. And that's what we get with Joe Biden and Barack Obama. \nFrom maintaining grant programs so fire departments nationwide have the safe staffing and equipment to support our people, that \u2014 President Obama and Vice President Biden have our backs. Supporting my voice to have collective bargaining on the job, President Obama has my back. \nPresident Obama has kept thousands of first responders on the job. And he's sent plans to Congress to keep even more of us working. The Republicans must stop obstructing progress and do the right thing for the middle class. They must pass the president's jobs plan.\n\nFor me, this election is about who respects middle-class workers like me and my family. I saw firsthand what the Republicans thought of me and my fellow public employees last year when Ohio legislators passed Senate Bill 5 in an attempt to silence us. We all know how that ended up. \nWhile they were not successful cutting our collective bargaining rights, they were successful in cutting funding for cities and towns all across Ohio. We've watched these so-called leaders claim that they didn't raise taxes, all the while knowing full well that they are forcing the local governments to raise those taxes or cut essential services, including police and fire. We feel their disdain for the very right to voice our concerns about safety matters, not just for ourselves but for the general public that we protect as well, when right-wing extremists threaten to take away the ability to negotiate with so-called right-to-work laws.\nBut let me \u2014 let me tell you what else we feel. We feel unified, and we feel stronger than ever. We've seen that the people of Ohio are onto their parlor tricks. Last year 63 percent of Ohio voters took a stand with public employees. They rejected Governor Kasich's Senate Bill 5. They said, enough. And voters this year have the opportunity to do the same all across the country. Enough of the vilification of the people who work for a living. Enough of the disrespect of the middle class. Enough of their far-right agenda.\nWe have a clear choice this campaign. The people I work with, the firemen that I hang out with, we have a simple statement. We support those who support us. \nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. ", "Thank you. Hello, Democrats! \nI'm proud to speak to you tonight as chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Under President Barack Obama, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus has been invited into the White House and given a seat at the table. Hispanics are serving in unprecedented numbers in this administration at the very highest levels, including the Cabinet. We made history when President Obama appointed Sonia Sotomayor \u2014 \nPresident Obama understands that for more than 50 million Hispanic Americans, their dream is the American dream, that we derive inspiration from our country's most enduring motto, \"E Pluribus Unum\" \u2014 out of many, one \u2014 and that we are an indispensable and indivisible part of this country.\nPresident Obama has led with principles, with vision and with values. And one of the most important values of Barack Obama is that he will always level with the American people. \nAnd then there's Mitt Romney. \nAdlai Stevenson famously said to Richard Nixon: If you stop telling lies about me, I'll stop telling the truth about you. \nAnd that's where we are today. When it comes to Medicare, the truth is that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan want to break the fundamental guarantee of Medicare and turn it into a voucher program and ship the cost to our seniors.\nWhen it comes to our country's immigration policies, the truth is that Mitt Romney has embraced the racial profiling policies of Arizona Governor Jan Brewer and Sheriff Joe Arpaio. \nThe truth is that he would separate families that have been here for generations. The truth is that he has embraced distrust and division at the expense of our American values.\nWhen it comes to America's economy, the truth is that Mitt Romney believes that the key to our country's economic future lies in the failed policies of the past. The same policy that put banks before people, Wall Street before Main Street, plunging us into a recession and devastating the middle class.\nThe truth is that Republicans in Congress were prepared to have America default on its debt just to forward their own narrow political agenda.\nThat's because perhaps the biggest lie the Republicans have told us is that they want to work with President Obama. But the truth is what they really want to do is undermine the president at the cost of our American values like justice, fairness and opportunity.\nNo matter the color of your skin or where you come from, we are all members of the American community, right? And America prospers, we prosper, when our neighbors are empowered, when they're equipped to give back to this country. And that is not measured by the size of one's bank account. It is measured by dedication and hard work. Justice, fairness and opportunity do not go to the highest bidder. They belong to the American who is willing to invest his or her energy to better themselves, to provide for their families and to build a brighter future.\nPresident Obama believes in an America where hard work pays off and responsibility is rewarded, where everyone gets a fair shot, does their fair share and plays by the same rules. President Obama knows that it is the middle class that makes America great, and that's why we have to grow our economy and create jobs.\nOver the past four years, President Obama's commitment to this vision has led to the rescue and has re-energized the American automobile industry and the more than 1 million jobs that depend on that industry, to pass health care reform, to make health care a right, not just a privilege, and to strengthen and to protect Medicare and to help young people to afford college and jump-start an American economy run on homegrown American energy sources.\n\nThe work that President Obama has undertaken has been opposed by congressional Republicans every step of the way. Nydia and I have been there. We have witnessed it. But he has kept moving America forward. President Obama holds true to the values and to the vision of which this country was founded.\nBut his work is not yet done. As part of this great country, Hispanics have and will continue to work for the best this country has to offer. Ready to do our part, we will work for policies that empower all Americans to be responsible and contributing members of the greatest country in the history of this world, the United States of America. \nWe've worked \u2014 we have worked for the American dream. Now we have to vote for the American dream. And when we do, we will re-elect Barack Obama as president of the United States. \nAnd now it is my great pleasure to introduce my good friend and a proud Latina from the great state of New York, Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez.\nThank you, Congressman Gonzalez. Tonight I am proud to speak to you as a patriotic Hispanic- American, as a proud Latina and as a Puerto Rican. \nIn Spanish, there is a saying that many mothers tell their children. Tell me with whom you walk, and I will tell you who you are. Tonight I want to talk about who I have seen President Obama walk with. President Obama has walked with our small businesses, our job creators. He knows small businesses are the backbone of our economy. That is why he has signed 18 tax cuts into law to help our entrepreneurs succeed.\nPresident Obama has walked with seniors. President Obama's health care law won the support of the AARP because it strengthened Medicare without cutting benefits and helped millions of seniors with free preventive care and more affordable prescription drugs.\n\nPresident Obama has walked with our young people, America's future. \u2014 to Head Start, to community college, to job training.\nPresident Obama has walked with America's women. President Obama is helping women access preventive health services like cancer screening, contraceptions, and well women exams.\nMeanwhile, Mitt Romney and Republicans in Congress would like to roll back a woman's access to important preventive care, turn over women's health decisions to their bosses and defund Planned Parenthood. \nAnd President Obama has walked with the Hispanic community. \nMitt Romney, on the other hand \u2014 Mitt Romney, on the other hand, is walking away from us.\n\nPresident Obama has worked with us for the last four years, in good times and in tough times. And now we are going to work with the president. \n", "Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nOur platform is crafted by Democrats, but it is not about partisanship; it's about pragmatism.\nIt's not about left or right but about moving America and our economy forward. \nOur platform and our president stand firm in the conviction that America must continue to outbuild, outinnovate and outeducate the world. \nWe must choose forward. We must choose inclusion. We must choose growing together. We choose American might and American muscle, standing strong on the bedrock of the American ideal, a strong and empowered and ever-expanding and ever-growing middle class. \nOur platform emphasizes that a vibrant, free and fair market is essential to economic growth. We also must pull from our highest ideals of justice and fairness to protect against those ills that destabilized our economy in recent years, like predatory lending, overleveraged financial institutions and the unchecked avarice of the past that trumped fairness and common sense.\nOur platform calls for significant cuts in federal spending. Our platform calls for a balanced deficit reduction plan, where everyone \u2014 everyone, from elected officials to the wealthy and the super- wealthy, pay their fair share. \nAnd please listen to this, because when your country is in a costly war with our soldiers sacrificing abroad and our nation is facing a debt crisis at home, being asked to pay your fair share isn't class warfare. It's patriotism. \nWe all know \u2014Now, we all know \u2014 we all know that it's common sense that for economy built to last, we must invest in what will fuel our economy for generations to come. This is our history. From the transcontinental railroad to the Hoover Dam; from the dredging of ports to the building of our most historic bridges, our American ancestors prioritized growth and investment in our nation's infrastructure.\nAnd today \u2014 and today our businesses, industries, entrepreneurs and economy realize a return on those investments.\nLet us not fall prey to the rhetoric that seeks to gut investment and starve our nation of critical, common-sense building for our future. And investment must include the real engine of job growth in America, the American small business. \nThat's why this platform committee is proud that our president has made a profound difference for people and businesses in Newark, in New Jersey and in our nation as a whole by cutting taxes for all working families and giving small businesses 18 different tax cuts. \nFor our president, \"home of the brave\" are not just the last words of our national anthem but also a call to action. This is why the president's policies and our platform include incentives to train and hire our troops returning home, not only \u2014 not only because it's our moral responsibility but because it makes for a stronger, more secure American economy. \nBut investing in people does not stop with our troops. Our platform and our president make it clear that the most critical investment we can make in a 21st-century knowledge-based economy is education.\n\nAnd so our president has already doubled Pell Grants, raised education standards, invested in research and development at our universities and early childhood education in our neighborhoods. \nIt is plain that our platform and our president are not interested in petty political arguments. Instead, this platform of big and practical ideas sets forth an emboldened pathway towards the historic hope which has driven generation after generation of Americans forward. It is our fundamental national aspiration that no matter who you are, no matter what color or creed, how you choose to pray or who you choose to love, that if \u2014 \u2014 that if you are a citizen of the United States of America, if you are an American, first generation or 15th, one who is willing to work hard, play by the rules and apply your God-given talents that you should be able to find a job that pays the bills.\nYou should be able to afford health care for your family. You should be able \u2014 \nThis is our platform. This is our platform. This is our platform. This \u2014 \nAnd so \u2014 and so \u2014 God bless America. God bless America. \nAnd so \u2014 and so this November, with the re-election of President Barack Obama \u2014 \nAnd so, Mr. Chairman, on behalf of every single member from every single state in these United States, we are pleased to move for the adoption of the 2012 Democratic National Platform. ", "Do we know how to have a party?\n\nIt's my privilege, on behalf of the people of North Carolina, to welcome you all to the Queen City, Charlotte, in the great great state of North Carolina. \nNow, it's always an honor for me as the governor to welcome a distinguished group of national leaders to North Carolina. But it's particularly exciting today because of why we're here: to make sure that Barack Obama is re-elected president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.Four more years! Four more years!\nWe must \u2014We must re-elect the president \u2014 listen up, we must re-elect the president because he's standing up for middle-class families and growing our economy \u2014 an economy that is built to last. And he's doing it all over the country and right here in North Carolina.\nMy friends, it starts with education. The president has made schools a top priority. He actually understands that all parents want their children to have even better opportunities than they had as a child. This president's education initiatives are helping North Carolina schools and schools across America soar. These investments are moving education reform and innovation and strengthening our nationally recognized early childhood education program.\nThis president, my friend, simply gets it on education. And that's a good thing for America. He knows \u2014 President Obama knows that education is the difference-maker for every child and it's the pathway for this country to succeed in a global economy.\nSo from education to broadband, from building roads and bridges to supporting the military, Barack Obama is delivering for North Carolina, and he is delivering for America. A growing middle class is simply the foundation for a strong America.\nAnd President Obama is also standing up for women in North Carolina and in America. He has helped women across this country fight for equal pay for equal work. He understands that women must be guaranteed access to quality, affordable health care and make sure that their insurance coverage pays for those costs with no out-of- pocket costs.\nAnd unlike Mitt Romney \u2014 unlike Mitt Romney, President Obama is standing up for Planned Parenthood. \nNow, this election \u2014 this election that we're all working so hard to make happen \u2014 this election is about the future.\nWe each have a choice in this country. We can go back to the same old failed economic policies that brought about the worst recession since the Great Depression, or we can go back to economic plans that are designed to benefit only the wealthiest among us, like Mitt Romney \u2014 \nFor me \u2014 for me and for North Carolina and for the people in America, it's an easy choice. Join with me as we take North Carolina. We will win this state. We will return Barack Obama to the White House. ", "Hello, delegates. Hello to my sisters and brothers in the American labor movement. \nMy name is Mary Kay Henry, and I'm here tonight on behalf of millions of Americans who work hard for a living. The home-care worker in Columbus, the janitor in Denver, the correctional officer in Raleigh: These are the men and women who make America strong. And these are the men and women who President Obama is fighting for each and every day. \nI grew up in southeast Michigan, just a few \u2014 \u2014 just a few miles from Mitt Romney, a few miles away but a world apart. And here is the thing: Even though Mitt Romney and I both call Detroit home, it seems like he learned a very different set of values.\nWhen Mitt started out in business, he invested in the companies who were pioneering outsourcing. He loaded up companies with debt, and when they went bankrupt, he walked away with profits. And he left workers who lost their health care, their pensions and even their jobs. \nWe've just learned that his company, when it found itself in trouble, asked for a government bailout. But when more than 1 million auto workers from Michigan to Wisconsin to Ohio saw their companies fall on hard times, you know what Mitt Romney said?\nLet Detroit go bankrupt. \nTime after time \u2014 time after time, working families have paid the price for Mitt Romney's success. Those are his values. And make no mistake: Those are the values he would bring to the White House. As president, Mitt Romney, would raise taxes on the middle-class Americans by an average of $2,000 a year \u2014 \nThe Romney-Ryan budget would cut education up to 20 percent while protecting tax loopholes for companies who send jobs overseas.\nGovernor Romney would replace the guarantee of Medicare with a voucher system. \nBut when it comes to subsidies for oil companies, well, Mitt Romney thinks that that's something worth protecting.\nMiddle-class Americans cannot afford four years of Romney economics. \nWe have a president who fights for women like Maria. Maria is a custodian from California, and thanks to health care reform, her daughter is covered under health insurance, and Maria's mother will never have to worry about losing her Medicare benefits.\nWe have a president who has fought for hardworking immigrants like Brenda, who came to this country when she was just 3 years old. And thanks to executive action by the president, Brenda can pursue a college career without fear of deportation. \nWe have a president who has fought for the right to collectively bargain. We have a president who wants workers to earn a decent wage, for the principle that all work has value and that every worker deserves respect.\nSo for millions of middle-class families across this country, the choice is clear. We cannot move backward with Mitt Romney. We must keep America moving forward, and that's why we need to re-elect President Barack Obama. ", "I wish you all could have met my parents. They were amazing people, and I miss them every day. They'd be so happy to see how far I've come. In fact, the last thing my dad said to me was that he was proud I was taking school seriously for the first time in a long time.\nBoth of my parents were scientists, and they wanted me to be a scientist. But I've always been more interested in how we pick our leaders and how they help us, so I'm making a compromise. I'm studying political science. \nAt 28, I'm two semesters away from graduating the University of Colorado. \nAnd while I'm determined to get my degree, I also can't sit on the sidelines. That's why I'm knocking on doors for President Obama.\nHe believes no child should use his parents \u2014 should see his parents suffer like I did and that all of us deserve the education we need to get the jobs our country needs.\nBut Governor Romney's plan could reduce Pell Grants for 10 million young people like me. \nThank you. ", "I am proud to be here, I'm proud to be an American and I am proud to be a Democrat.\n\nThese speeches are great, but the most important thing we can do is create policy that improves the lives of everyday Americans. Sometimes that gets lost in the rhetoric and the commentary. But the fact is, Democratic policies are tough and smart and have improved our lives all over the country.\nLook, I know something about what it takes to keep this country safe. And I watched this president as he helped make America stronger. President Obama has brought our troops home and taken care of them upon their return. \nHe has taken the fight to our enemy and restored our alliances and improved our standing in the world. \nHe has ended \"don't ask, don't tell.\" \nIf President Obama is re-elected, America will continue to go forward.\nAnd now we have a chance to meet some of the people whose lives are better, thanks to President Obama, and to hear their stories.", "I am so pleased that I had a role in drafting this remarkable document. It embodies the values we hold dear as Democrats and as Americans, and it sets forth our great president's vision for our future where, together, we will reignite the American dream for all \u2014 \u2014 because the reality is \u2014 the reality is, four years ago, the American dream had slipped out of reach for too many, and it had turned into a nightmare for millions.\nPresident Obama changed our course. He invested in clean energy, and enacted the broadest tax cut in history, reducing taxes on the middle class to near historic lows.\n\nToday our economy is growing again. Our platform states that America faces a clear choice: Move forward as a nation where everyone has a chance to get ahead or go back to the same failed ideas that created the crisis in the first place \u2014 in the first place. \nRepublicans will raise taxes on low income and the middle class to pay for tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. \nAnd they'll allow insurance companies to once again deny health care to working families and interfere with women's health care decisions. \nPresident Obama and Democrats will not let this happen. We will not. We will move forward, not backward.\nWe believe we are bound together by a shared set of ideals and values rooted in the notion that together, we can overcome the greatest challenges that come our way. We stand for an economy that's built not from the top down but from the middle out and that provides opportunity for those aspiring to join the middle class. \nAnd yes, we make ending poverty a national priority. \nThank you. Thank you, Democrats. ", "That's right. Si se puede.\nThank you.\nThank you, Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz. I love you. Thank you for your leadership of this great party and your role in planning this convention.\nI'm honored to serve as the chair of this historic 2012 Democratic National Convention, where we will renominate President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. \nAnd as I introduce the \u2014 as the permanent chair of the 2012 convention, as I introduce the first official to act here, Congressman Steny Hoyer, to give remarks on behalf of the convention parliamentarians. Thank you. ", "Thank you so much. \nWelcome. Welcome, delegates, alternates, standing committee members, special guests, friends, members of the news media, guests from around the world and fellow Americans, to our deliberations.\nOver the next three days we will hold the most open and accessible political convention in history. \nDuring our national convention, we will clearly demonstrate why we need to keep Barack Obama and Joe Biden in the White House. But this convention is about more than renominating President Obama. It's about Americans coming together to build one economy, not from the top down but from the middle class out and the bottom up.\n\nWe have \u2014 we're so proud that we have the largest number of delegates ever assembled at a Democratic National Convention. \nThe Democratic Party is the oldest continuing party in the world, and your participation in this convention is a testament to the fact that we are also the most vibrant, inclusive and energized political party, aren't we? \nSo now for some housekeeping. At this time let me remind delegates that presidential nominating petitions must be submitted to the Office of the Secretary no later than 6:00 p.m. today. Vice presidential nominating petitions must be submitted to the Office of the Secretary no later than 9:00 a.m. Wednesday. Petitions should be delivered to the secretary's office, which is located on the floor level concourse.\nDelegates, alternates and guests, please give a round of applause for the DJ for the convention, DJ Cassidy. \nAnd now I am pleased to introduce His Eminence Metropolitan Nicholas of Detroit to lead the invocation. ", "Thank you. I do so with humility, deeply moved by the trust you've placed in me. It's a great honor. It's an even greater responsibility. And tonight I'm asking you to join me to walk together to a better future.\nAnd by my side, I've chosen a man with a big heart from a small town. \nIn the days ahead, you're going to get to know Paul and Janna better. But last night America got to see what I saw in Paul Ryan \u2014 a strong and caring leader who's down to earth and confident in the challenge this moment demands, and I love the way he lights up around his kids, and how he's not embarrassed to show the world how much he loves his mom.\n\nFour years ago I know that many Americans felt a fresh excitement about the possibilities of a new president. That choice was not the choice of our party, but Americans always come together after elections. We're a good and generous people, and we're united by so much more than what divides us. When that election was over, when the yard signs came down and the television commercials finally came off the air, Americans were eager to go back to work, to live our lives the way Americans always have, optimistic and positive and confident in the future.\nThat very optimism is uniquely American. It's what brought us to America. We're a nation of immigrants. We're the children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the ones who wanted a better life, the driven ones, the ones who woke up at night hearing that voice telling them that life in the place called America could be better. They came not just in pursuit of the riches of this world, but for the richness of this life, freedom, freedom of religion \u2014 \nThis is the essence of the American experience. We Americans have always felt a special kinship with the future.\nWhen every new wave of immigrants looked up and saw the Statue of Liberty or knelt down and kissed the shores of freedom just 90 miles from Castro's tyranny, these new Americans surely had many questions. But none doubted that here in America, they could build a better life, that in America, their children would be blessed more than they.\nBut today, four years from the excitement of that last election, for the first time, the majority of Americans now doubt that our children will have a better future. It's not what we were promised. Every family in America wanted this to be a time when they could get a little ahead, put aside a little more for college, do more for the elderly mom that's now living alone or give a little more to their church or their charity. Every small business wanted these to be their best years ever, when they could hire more, do more for those who had stuck with them through the hard times, open a new store or sponsor that Little League team. And every new college graduate thought they'd have a good job by now, a place of their own, they could start paying back some of their loans and build for the future.\nThis is when our nation was supposed to start paying down the national debt and rolling back those massive deficits. This was the hope and change America voted for. It's not just what we wanted. It's not just what we expected. It's what Americans deserve. You deserved it because during these years you worked harder than ever before. You deserved it because when it cost more to fill up your car, you could out \u2014 cut out movie nights and put in longer hours. Or when you lost that job that paid 22.50 You deserve it because your family depended on you, and you did it because you're an American, and you don't quit. You did it because it was what you had to do. But driving home late from that second job or standing there watching the gas pump hit $50 and still going, when the realtor told you that to sell your house, you'd have to take a big loss, in those moments you knew that this just wasn't right.\nBut what could you do except work harder, do with less, try to stay optimistic, hug your kids a little longer, maybe spend a little more time praying that tomorrow would be a better day?\nI wish President Obama had succeeded because I want America to succeed. But his promises gave way to disappointment and division.\nThis isn't something we have to accept. Now is the moment when we can do something. And with your help, we will do something. \nNow is the moment when we can stand up and say, I'm an American, I make my destiny, we deserve better, my children deserve better, my family deserves better, my country deserves better. \nSo here we stand. Americans have a choice, a decision. To make that choice, you need to know more about me and where I'd lead our country.\nI was born in the middle of the century in the middle of the country, a classic baby boomer. It was a time when Americans were returning from war and eager to work. To be an American was to assume that all things were possible. When President Kennedy challenged Americans to go to the moon, the question wasn't whether we'd get there, it was only when we'd get there. God bless Neil Armstrong. \nTonight that American flag is still there on the moon, and I don't doubt for a second that Neil Armstrong's spirit is still with us, that unique blend of optimism, humility and the utter confidence that when the world needs someone to do the really big stuff, you need an American. \nMy dad had been born in Mexico, and his family had to leave during the Mexican Revolution. I grew up with stories of his family being fed by the U.S. government as war refugees. My dad never made it through college, and he apprenticed as a lath and plaster carpenter.\nHe had big dreams. He convinced my mom, a beautiful young actress, to give up Hollywood to marry him and move to Detroit. He led a great \u2014 \nWe were \u2014 we were Mormons, and growing up in Michigan, that might have seemed unusual or out of place, but I really don't remember it that way. My friends cared more about what sports teams we followed than what church we went to.\nMy mom and dad gave their kids the \u2014 the greatest gift of all \u2014 the gift of unconditional love. They cared deeply about who we would be and much less about what we would do. Unconditional love is a gift that Ann and I have tried to pass on to our sons and now to our grandchildren. All the laws and legislation in the world will never heal this world like the loving hearts and arms of mothers and fathers. You know, if every children could drift asleep feeling wrapped in the love of their family, and God's love, this world would be a far more gentle and better place.\n\nMy mom and dad were married for 64 years. And if you wondered what their secret was, you could have asked the local florist \u2014 \u2014 because every day Dad gave Mom a rose, which he put on her bedside table. That's how she found out what happened on the day my father died. She went looking for him because that morning there was no rose.\nMy mom and dad were true partners, a life lesson that shaped my by everyday example. When my mom ran for the Senate, my dad was there for her every step of the way. I can still see her saying, in her beautiful voice, why should women have any less say than men about the great decisions facing our nation? \nDon't you wish she could have been here at this convention \u2014 As governor of Massachusetts, I chose a woman lieutenant governor, a woman chief of staff. Half of my Cabinet and senior officials were women. And in business, I mentored and supported great women leaders who went on to run great companies.\nI grew up in Detroit in love with cars and wanted to be a car guy like my dad. But by the time I was out of school, I realized that I had to go out on my own, that if I stayed around in the same business, I'd never really know if I was getting a break because of my dad. I wanted to go someplace new and prove myself.\nThose weren't the easiest of days, many long hours and weekends working, five young sons who seemed to have this need to re-enact a different world war every night. But if you asked Ann and I what we'd give to break up just one more fight between the boys or wake up in the morning and discover a pile of kids asleep in our room \u2014 well, every mom and dad knows the answer to that.\nThose days were the \u2014 \nAnd as America saw Tuesday night, Ann would have succeeded at anything she wanted to do. \nLike a lot of families in a new place with no family, we \u2014 we found kinship with a wide circle of friends through our church. When we were new to the community, it was welcoming. And as the years went by, it was a joy to help others who had just moved into town or just joined our church.\nWe had remarkably vibrant and diverse congregations from all walks of life, and many who were new to America. We prayed together. Our kids played together. And we always stood ready to help each other out in different ways.\nThat's how it is in America. We look to our communities, our faiths, our families for our joy, our support in good times and bad. It's both how we live our lives and why we live our lives. The strength and power and goodness of America has always been based on the strength and power and goodness of our communities, our families and our faiths. \nThat's the bedrock of what makes America America. In our best days we can feel the vibrancy of America's communities, large and small. It's when we see that new business opening up downtown. It's when we go to work in the morning and see everybody else on the block doing the same thing. It's when our son or daughter calls from college to talk about which job they \u2014 offer they should take, and you try not to choke up when you hear that the one they like best is not too far from home. It's that good feeling when you have more time to volunteer to coach your kids' soccer team or help out on school trips.\nBut for too many Americans, those kind of good days are harder to come by. How many days have you woken up feeling that something really special was happening in America?\nMany of you felt that way on Election Day four years ago. Hope and change had a powerful appeal.\nBut tonight I'd ask a simple question.\nIf you felt that excitement when you voted for Barack Obama, shouldn't you feel that way now that he's President Obama? \nThe president hasn't disappointed you because he wanted to. The president has disappointed America because he hasn't led America in the right direction. He took office with \u2014 without the basic qualification that most Americans have, and one that was essential to the task at hand: He had almost no experience working in a business. Jobs, to him, are about government. \nI learned the real lessons about how America works from experience. When I was 37, I helped start a small company. My partners and I had been working for a company that was in the business of helping other businesses. So some of us had this idea that if we really believed our advice was helping companies, we should invest in companies; we should bet on ourselves and our \u2014 on our advice. So we started a new business called Bain Capital.\nThe only problem was, while \u2014 while we believed in ourselves, not many other people did. We were young and had never done this before, and we almost didn't get off the ground. In those days, sometimes I wondered if I had made a really big mistake.\nBy the way, I'd thought about asking my church's pension fund to invest, but I didn't. I figured it was bad enough that I might lose my investors' money, but I didn't want to go to hell, too.\n\nThat business we started with 10 people has now grown into a great American success story. Some of the companies we helped start are names you \u2014 you know and you've heard from tonight: an office company called Staples, where I'm pleased to see the Obama campaign's been shopping \u2014 \u2014 today Steel Dynamics is one of the largest steel producers in the United States.\nThese \u2014 \nNow \u2014 now, we weren't always successful at Bain, but no one ever is in the real world of business. That's what this president doesn't seem to understand. Business and growing jobs is about taking risk, sometimes failing, sometimes succeeding, but always striving. It's about dreams. Usually, it doesn't work out exactly as you might have imagined. Steve Jobs was fired at Apple, and then he came back and changed the world.\nIt's the genius of the American free enterprise system to harness the extraordinary creativity and talent and industry of the American people with a system that's dedicated to creating tomorrow's prosperity, not trying to redistribute today's. \nThat's why \u2014 that's why every president since the Great Depression who came before the American people asking for a second term could look back at the last four years and say with satisfaction: You're better off than you were four years ago. Except Jimmy Carter. \nThis president can ask us to be patient. This president can tell us it was someone else's fault. This president can tell us that the next four years he'll get it right. But this president cannot tell us that you're better off today than when he took office.\n\nAmerica's been patient. Americans have supported this president in good faith. But today the time has come to turn the page. Today the time has come for us to put the disappointments of the last four years behind us, to put aside the divisiveness and the recriminations, to forget about what might have been and to look ahead to what can be. Now is a time to restore the promise of America. \nMany Americans have given up on this president, but they haven't ever thought about giving up, not on themselves, not on each other and not on America. What is needed in our country today is not complicated or profound. Doesn't take a special government commission to tell us what America needs. What America needs is jobs, lots of jobs. \nIn the richest country in the history of the world, this Obama economy has crushed the middle class. Family income has fallen by $4,000, but health insurance premiums are higher. Food prices are higher. Utility bills are higher. And gasoline prices, they've doubled. Today more Americans wake up in poverty than ever before. Nearly 1-out-of-6 Americans is living in poverty. Look around you. These aren't strangers. These are our brothers and sisters, our fellow Americans. His policies have not helped create jobs. They've depressed them.\nAnd this I can tell you about where President Obama would take America.\nHis plan to raise taxes on small business won't add jobs: It would eliminate them. And his trillion-dollar deficits, they slow our economy, restrain employment and cause wages to stall.\nTo the majority of Americans who now believe that the future will not be better than the past, I can guarantee you this: If Barack Obama is re-elected, you'll be right. \nI'm running for president to help create a better future \u2014 a future where everyone who wants a job can find a job \u2014 \u2014 where no senior feels for the \u2014 fears for the security of their retirement, an America where every parent knows that their child will get an education that leads them to a good job and a bright horizon.\nAnd unlike the president, I have a plan to create 12 million new jobs. \nSecond, we'll give our fellow citizens the skills they need for the jobs of today and the careers of tomorrow. When it comes to the school your child will attend, every parent should have a choice and every child should have a chance. \nThird, we'll make trade work for America by forging new trade agreements. And when nations cheat in trade, there will be unmistakable consequences. \nAnd fourth, to assure every entrepreneur and every job creator that their investments in America will not vanish as have those in Greece, we will cut the deficit and put America on track to a balanced budget. \nAnd fifth, we will champion small businesses, America's engine of job growth. That means reducing taxes on business, not raising them. It means simplifying and modernizing the regulations that hurt small business the most. \nToday women are more likely than men to start a business. They need a president who respects and understands what they do.\nAnd let me make this very clear: unlike President Obama, I will not raise taxes on the middle class of America. \nAs president, I'll protect the sanctity of life. I'll honor the institution of marriage. \nPresident Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans \u2014 \nI will begin my presidency with a jobs tour. President Obama began his presidency with an apology tour. America, he said, had dictated to other nations. No, Mr. President, America has freed other nations from dictators. Every American \u2014Every American was relieved the day President Obama gave the order and Seal Team 6 took out Osama bin Laden. \nOn another front, every American is less secure today because he has failed to slow Iran's nuclear threat. In his first TV interview as president, he said we should talk to Iran. We're still talking, and Iran's centrifuges are still spinning.\nPresident Obama has thrown allies like Israel under the bus \u2014 \nWe will honor America's democratic ideals, because a free world is a more peaceful world. This is the bipartisan foreign policy legacy of Truman and Reagan, and under my presidency, we will return to it once again. \nYou might have asked yourself if these last years are really the America we want \u2014\u2014 the America that was won for us by \"the greatest generation.\"\nDoes the America we want borrow a trillion dollars from China?Does it fail to find the jobs that are needed for 23 million people and for half the kids graduating from college?Are those schools lagging behind the rest of the developed world?And does America that we want succumb to resentment and division among Americans?The America we all know has been a story of the many becoming one, uniting to preserve liberty, uniting to build the greatest economy in the world, uniting to save the world from unspeakable darkness. Everywhere I go in America, there are monuments that list those who have given their lives for America. There's no mention of their race, their party affiliation or what they did for a living. They lived and died under a single flag, fighting for a single purpose.\nThey pledged allegiance to the United States of America. That America, that united America, can unleash an economy that will put Americans back to work, that will once again lead the world with innovation and productivity and that will restore every father and mother's confidence that their children's future is brighter even than the past.\nThat America, that united America, will preserve a military that's so strong no nation would ever dare to test it. \nThat America \u2014 that America, that united America, will uphold the constellation of rights that were endowed by our creator and codified in our Constitution. \nThat united America will care for the poor and the sick, will honor and respect the elderly and will give a helping hand to those in need.\nThat America is the best within each of us. That America we want for our children. If I'm elected president of these United States, I will work with all my energy and soul to restore that America, to lift our eyes to a better future. That future is our destiny. That future is out there. It is waiting for us. Our children deserve it. Our nation depends on it. The peace and freedom of the world require it, and with your help, we will deliver it. \nThank you so very much. May God bless you, may God bless the American people and may God bless the United States of America. ", "Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I think I just drank Clint Eastwood's water. Thank you. Boy, thank you so much. Thank you so much for having me here today, and thank you so much for doing this convention here in Florida.\nYou know, before I begin this \u2014 thank you. Before I begin, this is such an important night for our country. I want to take just \u2014 with your permission, just a few seconds to talk about another country, a country located just a few hundred miles away from this city, the country of my parents' birth. There is no freedom or liberty in Cuba. And tonight, I ask for your prayers that soon freedom and liberty will be theirs as well. \nIt \u2014 you know, this is a big honor for me. Just not so long ago I was just a deep underdog candidate. The only people that thought I could win all lived in my house. \nAnd \u2014 so I called a few people and asked them, what should I say? And they had a lot of different opinions, but the one thing they all said is, don't mess it up. \nSo I thought the best way to introduce Mitt Romney tonight, the next president of the United States \u2014 \nI watched my first convention in 1980 with my grandfather. My grandfather was born to a farming family in rural Cuba. Childhood polio left him permanently disabled. Because he couldn't work the farm, his family sent him to school. He was the only one in his family that knew how to read. He was a huge influence on me growing up. As a boy, I used to sit on the porch of our house and listen to his stories about history and politics and baseball as he would puff on one of his three daily Padron cigars.\nNow, I don't remember \u2014 it's been three decades since we last sat on that porch, and I don't remember all the things he talked to me about. But the one thing I remember is the one thing he wanted me never to forget, that the dreams he had when he was young became impossible to achieve. But there was no limit how far I could go, because I was an American. \nNow, for those of us \u2014 here's why I say that. Here's why I say that, because for those of us who were born and raised in this country, sometimes it becomes easy to forget how special America is. But my grandfather understood how different America was from the rest of the world because he knew life outside America.\nTonight you will hear from another man who understands what makes America exceptional.\n\nMitt Romney knows America's prosperity didn't happen because our government simply spent more money. It happened because our people used their own money to open a business. And when they succeed, they hire more people who invest or spend their money in the economy, helping others start a business or create jobs.\nNow tonight you have heard for a long time now about Mitt Romney's success in business. It's well-known. But we've also learned that he's so much more than that. Mitt Romney is a devoted husband, a father, a grandfather, a generous member of his community and church, a role model for younger Americans like myself. Everywhere he's been, he's volunteered his time and talent to make things better for those around him. And we are blessed that a man like this will soon be the president of these United States. \nNow, let me be clear so no one misunderstands. Our problem with President Obama isn't that he's a bad person, OK? By all accounts, he, too, is a good husband and a good father and, thanks to lots of practice, a good golfer. \nYou think he's watching tonight? Because his new slogan for his campaign is the word \"forward.\" Forward?\nA government that spends $1 trillion more than it takes in? An $800 billion stimulus that created more debt than jobs? A government intervention into health care paid for with higher taxes and cuts to Medicare, scores of new rules and regulations \u2014 these ideas don't move us forward. These ideas move us backwards. \nThese are tired and old big-government ideas that have failed every time and everywhere they've been tried. These are ideas that people come to America to get away from. \nAs for his old slogan, under Barack Obama, the only change is that hope is hard to find. \nNow, sadly, millions of Americans are insecure about their future. But instead of inspiring us, by reminding us of what makes us special, he divides us against each other. He tells Americans that they're worse off because others are better off, that rich people got rich by making other people poor. Hope and change has become divide and conquer. \nBut in the end, this election \u2014 it doesn't matter how you feel about President Obama because this election is about your future, not about his. And \u2014 \u2014 and this election is not simply a choice between a Democrat and a Republican.\nIt's a choice about what kind of country we want America to be. \nAnd as we prepare to make this choice, we should remember what made us special. You see, for most of human history, almost everybody was poor. Power and wealth only belonged to a few. Your rights were whatever your rulers allowed you to have. Your future was determined by your past. If you parents were poor, so would you be. If you were born without opportunities, so were your children.\nBut America was founded on the principle that every person has God-given rights \u2014 \nAnd we're special \u2014 we're special because we're united \u2014 we're united not as a common race or a common ethnicity, we're bound together by common values, that family's the most important institution in society \u2014 \nWe're special \u2014 we're special because we've never made the mistake of believing that we are so smart that we can rely solely on our leaders or on our government \u2014 our national motto, \"In God we trust,\" reminding us that faith in our creator is the most important American value of them all.\n\nWell, my fellow Americans, we are a uniquely blessed people. And we have honored those blessings with the enduring example of an exceptional America. \nI know for many of you watching at home tonight, the last few years have tested your faith in the promise of America. Maybe you're at an age when you thought you would be entering retirement, but now because your savings and investments are wiped out, your future is uncertain. Maybe after years of hard work, this was the time you expected to be your prime earning years, but instead you've been laid off, and your house is worth less than your mortgage. Maybe you did everything you were told you needed to do to get ahead, you studied hard and finished school, but now you owe thousands of dollars in student loans, you can't find a job in your field and you've had to move back in with your parents. You want to believe that we're still that special place where anything is possible, but you just don't seem \u2014 things just don't seem to be getting any better. And you wonder if things will ever be the same again.\nYes, we live in a troubled time, but the story of those who came before us reminds us that America has always been about new beginnings, and Mitt Romney is running for president because he knows that if we are willing to do for our children what our parents did for us, life in America can be better than it has ever been.\n\nMy mother was one of seven girls whose parents often went to bed hungry so their children wouldn't. My father lost his mother when he was 9. He had to leave school and go to work, and he would work for the next 70 years of his life. They immigrated to America with little more than the hope of a better life. My dad was a bartender. My mom was a cashier, a hotel maid, a stock clerk at Kmart. They never made it big. They were never rich. And yet they were successful, because just a few decades removed from hopelessness, they made possible for us all the things that had been impossible for them.\nMany nights growing up, I would hear my father's keys jingling at the door as he came home after another 16-hour day. Many mornings I woke up just as my mother got home from the overnight shift at Kmart. When you're young and you're in a hurry, the meaning of moments like this escape you. But now as my children get older, I understand it better.\nMy dad used to tell us, en ese pais, ustedes van a poder lograr todas las cosas que nosotros no pudimos \u2014 \u2014 in this country \u2014 in this country, you're going to be able to accomplish all the things we never could. A few years ago during a speech, I noticed a bartender behind a portable bar in the back of the ballroom. And I remembered my father, who worked for many years as a banquet bartender. He was grateful for the work he had. But that's not the life he wanted for us.\nYou see, he stood behind a bar and \u2014 in the back of the room all those years so one day I could stand behind a podium in the front of a room. \nThat journey, that journey from behind that bar to behind this podium goes to the essence of the American miracle, that we're exceptional not because we have more rich people here; we're special because dreams that are impossible anywhere else, they come true here.\nBut \u2014 \u2014 but that's not just my story. That's your story. That's our story. That's the story of your mothers who struggled to give you what they never had. That's the story of your fathers who worked two jobs so that the doors that had been closed for them would be open for you. That's the story of that teacher or that coach that taught you the lessons that made you who you are today.\nAnd it's the story of a man who was born into an uncertain future in a foreign country. His family came to America to escape revolution. They struggled through poverty and the Great Depression. And yet he rose to be an admired businessman and public servant. And in November his son Mitt Romney will be elected president of these United States. \nIn America \u2014In America, we are all just a generation or two removed from someone who made our future the purpose of their lives. America is the story of everyday people who did extraordinary things, a story woven deep into the fabric of our society. Their stories may never be famous, but in the lives they live, you will find the essence of America's greatness. And to make sure that America is still a place where tomorrow is always better than yesterday, that is what our politics should be about, and that is what we are deciding this election. \nWe decide, do we want our children to inherit our hopes and dreams, or do we want them to inherit our problems? Because Mitt Romney believes that if we succeed in changing the direction of our country, our children and grandchildren will be the most prosperous generation ever, and their achievements will astonish the world. \nThe story of our time will be written by Americans who haven't yet even been born. Let us make sure they write that we did our part, that in the early years of this new century, we lived in an uncertain time, but we did not allow fear to cause us to abandon what made us special. We chose more government instead of more freedom . We chose the principles of our founding to solve the challenges of our time.\nWe chose a special man to lead us in a special time. We chose Mitt Romney to lead our nation. And because we did, the American miracle lives on for another generation to inherit. \nMy fellow Republicans, my fellow Americans, I am proud to introduce to you the next president of the United States of America, Mitt Romney! ", "Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nNow, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, what's a movie tradesman doing out here? You know, they're all left-wingers out there, left of Lenin. At least that's what people think, but that's not really the case. There is a lot of conservative people, a lot of moderate people, Republicans, Democrats in Hollywood. It's just that conservative people, by the nature of the word itself, are \u2014 play it a little more close to vest. They don't go around hot- dogging it.\nSo \u2014 Jon's here, an Academy Award winner, terrific guy. And these people are all like-minded, like all of us.\nSo I've got \u2014 I've got Mr. Obama sitting here. \nAnd then finally \u2014 I haven't cried that hard since I found out that there's 23 million unemployed people in this country. \nSo, Mr. President, how do you \u2014 how do you handle \u2014 or how do you handle promises that you've made when you're running for election, and how do you handle \u2014 how do you handle it? I mean, what do you say to people? Do you \u2014 do you just \u2014 \u2014 OK.\nWell, I know even some of the people in your own party who were very disappointed when you didn't close Gitmo. And I thought \u2014 well, I think closing Gitmo, why close that? We spent so much money on it.\nBut I thought maybe it's an excuse \u2014 you know, what do you mean shut up? \nI've got a \u2014 I've got to hand it to you. I've got to give credit where credit's due. You did overrule that finally, and that's \u2014 so now we're moving onward.\nAnd I know in the \u2014 I know you were against the war in Iraq, and that's OK. But you thought the war in Afghanistan was OK. You know, I mean, you thought that was something that was worth doing. We didn't check with the Russians to see how they did there for the 10 years. But we did it. And it was \u2014 you know, it's something to be thought about. And I think that when we get to maybe \u2014 I think you mentioned something about having a target date for bringing everybody home.\nAnd you give that target date, and I think Mr. Romney asked the only sensible question on it. He said, why are you giving the date out now? Why don't you just bring them home tomorrow morning? So anyway, we got \u2014 we're going to have \u2014 we're going to have to have a little chat about that.\nAnd then I just wondered, these \u2014 all these promises. And then I wondered about, you know, when the \u2014 what? What do you want me to tell Romney? I can't tell him to do that. Can't do that to himself. .\nSo anyway \u2014 but I just \u2014 I just think that there's so much to be done. And I think that Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan are two guys that can come along. I \u2014 see, I never thought that it was a good idea for attorneys to be president anyway, because it's \u2014 \u2014 yeah.\nI think \u2014 I think attorneys are so busy \u2014 you know, they're always taught to argue everything and always weigh everything and weigh both sides, and they're always \u2014 you know, they're always \u2014 Mr. Devil's advocating this and bifurcating this and bifurcating that \u2014 you know, all of that stuff. But I think it's maybe time \u2014 what do you think \u2014 for maybe a businessman. How about that? \nA stellar businessman, quote-unquote, a stellar businessman. And I think it's that time. And I think if you just kind of stepped aside and Mr. Romney can kind of take over \u2014 you can still use the plane \u2014 OK.\nWell, anyway \u2014 all right, I'm sorry. I can't do that to myself, either. Anyway, OK.\nBut I'd just like to say something, ladies and gentlemen, something that I think is very important. It is that you \u2014 we own this country. \u2014 so they're just going to come around and beg for votes every few years.\nIt's their same old deal. But I just think that it's important that you realize that \u2014 and \u2014 that you're the best in the world. And whether you're Democrat or whether you're Republican or whether you're libertarian or whatever, you're the best, and we should not ever forget that. And we \u2014 when somebody does not do the job, we've got to let them go. \nOK. Yeah. OK. Just remember that. And I'm speaking out for everybody out there. It doesn't hurt we don't have to be \u2014I don't say that word anymore. \nOK. You want to make my day, eh? All right. I \u2014 all right. I'll start it. You finish it.\nGo ahead.Thank you. Thank you very much. ", "Thank you for the warm welcome. I am honored to be here with you tonight to share my feelings about Mitt Romney. By way of background, my politics is as a liberal Democrat. My passion is about education, workforce training and leadership.\nWhen I first met Governor Romney, I was struck by his humanity, his grace, his kind manner.\nIt was just the two of us in his office when I met him as a finalist for a Cabinet position in his administration. I could tell immediately just by our interaction that he is the real thing, authentic. \nHe struck me then and now as honest, transparent and inclusive. I somehow knew during that meeting that he is demanding of himself, and \u2014 \u2014 he'd be demanding of anyone who is part of his administration. I wanted to be around him and in that kind of environment, where my energy, skills and talents could be channeled along with others toward the public good.\nI could tell by our conversation that the governor was in office not for himself or to promote himself but for the people. My initial size-up of the man held true. During the four years I served in his Cabinet, I saw him up close and personal many times. And he always drove us in his administration to make government better for the people.\nOne area where he made a positive difference is in improving the representation of women in senior positions in Massachusetts state government. \nBefore Governor Romney took office in 2003, women were significantly underrepresented among top roles in government, with 52 percent of the population but just 30 percent of the jobs. Over the next 2 1/2 years 42 percent of the new appointments made by Governor Romney were women. \nThis led the Boston Globe to note, women fill 10 of 20 top positions in Governor Mitt Romney's administration, making the Commonwealth one of five states that come close to matching the percentage of top women appointees to the proportion of women in the overall population. This achievement happened because Mitt Romney cared about the issue, he took action to fix it, and he delivered results. \nHe is unquestionably an amazing steward and leader, a servant leader and someone whom I respect very much. That's the kind of leadership that has always inspired me: unselfish leadership. \nThe late Stephen Covey writes about two kinds of people.\nOne type is all about themselves and their success, and the other type works as hard as they can \u2014 and certainly succeeds \u2014 but their success is motivated by doing good for others. That's how I see Governor Romney. He is authentic.\nHe is open to good ideas, wherever they come from. It doesn't matter if they're from a liberal Democrat like me. He'll listen, and he's inclusive. As a great leader, he brought out the best in me. And I know, as president, he will bring out the best in our country. ", "Thank you. Thank you.\nThese last few months I've heard a lot of false information about Bain Capital and private equity. I'm proud to stand here and tell you what I saw when Bain Capital bought the company where I worked. The experience improved my job, and it gave me opportunities that I always believed were part of the American dream.\nIn 1996 I became a sales rep at a contact lens business called Wesley Jessen. My sales region was right here in Florida, where my parents immigrated from Cuba when I was 13 years old \u2014 \nWesley Jessen had been struggling, losing over 50 million a year under the previous owner. Then Mitt Romney and Bain Capital came in. Bain Capital saw something others didn't see. They invested money in marketing. They brought in a charismatic and dynamic CEO, Kevin Ryan. They did everything to make the company succeed. This is the real Bain Capital \u2014 the story the Obama campaign doesn't want you to hear.\nBecause of Bain Capital's attention to management, Wesley Jessen roared back, and workers like me were inspired by what we saw, and our careers thrived.\nAnd when the company went public a few years later, I was well- rewarded. With that money, my wife, Sylvia, who's a pharmacist, and I, started our own business in Hialeah, Florida, Vida Pharmacy. and commitment to a struggling company. As a result, we're doing what we love: serving our community. We are building our future.\nStories like this need to be told. My life today is better because of Bain Capital. Mitt Romney helped turn around my company. I can't imagine anyone better-prepared to turn around this country. Thank you.", "Twenty-five years ago I had a crazy idea for a new business.\nI wanted to do to office supplies what Home Depot had done with home improvement. I pictured an office superstore for regular customers and small businesses. The business would be called Staples.\nIt wasn't easy at first. I had a vision and a business plan. Then I met Mitt Romney. He helped make it come alive.\nNow, Mitt was an unusual guy. He had already enjoyed great success in Bain & Company. But he knew the value of a dollar. When I told him about Staples, he got really excited at the idea of saving a few cents on paper clips. \nFunny thing. But I ask you, who would make a better president? Someone who knows how to save a dollar on pens and paper, or someone who knows how to waste $535 million on Solyndra? \nThe truth \u2014 the truth is Mitt was not a typical investor. He was a true partner. Where some saw an unproven new business, he saw a store that could save people money. He recognized that efficiency creates consumer value.\nAnd he never looked at Staples merely as a financial investment. He saw the engine of prosperity it would become. Today Staples employs nearly 90,000 people. It has over 2,000 stores, over 50 distribution centers. For me \u2014 for me, as a founder, it was the realization of a dream.\nSo you can imagine my dismay when I see this White House and their campaign demonizing Mitt Romney, demonizing Bain Capital and demonizing the private equity industry that has created so many new jobs. \nNow, you have to ask yourself, why would an administration that can't create any jobs demonize someone who did? You know, they say Mitt Romney is out of touch with ordinary Americans. They just don't get it. The night before we opened the first store, I asked our people to do back-to-back all-nighters. That's when I got a phone call from Mitt. He wanted to come over and talk with the team and spend some time with them, and he told me in very clear terms: Tom, this business is all about the people.\nBut this Obama-Biden campaign, they just don't get it. They will tell you that private equity is focused only on the short term. Tell that to the founders of Bright Horizons day care, a company that has transformed corporate day care. Most people didn't give the business a chance. It went five straight years without making a profit, but Mitt and Bain Capital stood by them.\nMitt and Bain Capital believed in the vision, and they understood how important it was for women to join the workforce and have on-site day care for their children. \nBut President Obama and his friends, they just don't get it.The Obama campaign will tell you that Bain Capital was a form of \"vampire capitalism,\" draining the blood from a company and move on. They just don't get it.You know, where were they when Mitt stayed with Staples for 15 years, long after Bain Capital had sold its stock? Where were they when Bain Capital helped start Steel Dynamics when most people had given up on the American steel industry? Eighteen years later, that company employs 6,000 people. But this administration, they just don't get it.You know, they've got a job council that never meets, a Democratic Senate that doesn't act, a president who doesn't believe and a vice president who just can't stop talking. They just don't get it.And you know, they don't get it because they don't believe in the spirit of the entrepreneur. They don't understand what it means to risk money to create something new.\nAnd they don't understand the hard work it takes to get a business off the ground, the sacrifices you make, the Little League games you miss. They don't see this as a country of opportunity where someone like myself, the son of immigrants, born in Newark, New Jersey \u2014 and proud of that, Governor Christie \u2014 \u2014 can live the American dream.\nWell, let me tell you, my friend Mitt Romney gets it. ", "Thank you, thank you. I have a question. I have a question for you. Wasn't Ann Romney spectacular on Tuesday night? I agree, and Ann had some really great stories about Mitt. And so do I.\nFor 30 years I have been at Mitt Romney's side when he did extraordinary things. As Mitt says, I'm his wingman. I was there when Mitt turned around desperate situations, fixed big, broken things and had a profoundly positive impact on people's lives.\nOur journey began when Mitt asked a small group of us to help him start an investment firm called Bain Capital. Integrity, respect, responsibility, trust \u2014 these are not just words to Mitt Romney.\nThese are principles he lives by. \nHe also applied them to the way we worked. First, he built a team. He recruited the best people he could find, reached out for ideas, encouraged dissent and fostered real cooperation.\nNext, he gave us a clarity of purpose. Our investors included pension funds, colleges and charities with noble missions. We would invest wisely, and we would treat their money as carefully as we treated our own. We would support entrepreneurs, and we would invest in troubled situations. We would help them grow and try to make their companies better. And we would be held accountable for our performance. And when things went wrong, we would not blame others. \nAnd finally, he took decisive action. Mitt never hesitated. He made tough decisions, coalesced a team and moved forward. Time and time again I have seen this decisive leadership. When our old consulting firm was on the verge of collapse, they asked Mitt to come back and help. He answered the call. When many thought the situation was hopeless, Mitt was not deterred. I'll never forget when he said, Bob, a thousand employees and their family depend on us, and we cannot let them down.\n\nWhen the obstacles seemed insurmountable and others panicked, Mitt was the calm in the storm, and he never lost hope. His confidence gave us confidence. And that company not only survived, it thrived. And today Bain & Company is recognized as one of the best places to work in America. \nI saw something similar when Mitt was asked to help save the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics. When we first realized the magnitude of the financial and management challenges, I was skeptical whether they could be saved. Mitt never doubted what could be done. He applied the same principles of leadership, and the Olympics became a story that made America proud. \nAnd when Mitt was elected governor of Massachusetts, he asked that I help him assemble a team that would serve the public trust and be loyal to the principles he held dear. That team accomplished so much because they got Republicans and Democrats to focus on the real problems and achieve real results. \nSo why has Mitt taken so many challenges? It's because he runs towards problems, believes it's important to make a difference and is determined to always give something back.\nIn every pursuit, he feels a sense of responsibility and a commitment to serve.\nEven though we worked endless hours at Bain Capital, Mitt found time to serve his church and counsel people in need. And if someone needed help, Mitt was there.\nWhen our partner's daughter went missing in New York, Mitt said, we can't just stand by and do nothing; we have to go find her. He closed down our entire office, took all of us to Boston, mobilized the search efforts. \nMitt wanted us to give something back too. He inspired the formation of Bain Capital Children's Charity. It not only donated money to worthy children's causes, it got Bain Capital employees actively involved in their communities.\nGo back and look at every pursuit in Mitt's life. Surrounding him are people who have worked with him over and over again. They trust him, they respect him, they want to be part of his team, and they want to be part of the change. And today we need urgent change in Washington. \nAnd we need \u2014 we need a proven leader with passion and compassion. I have seen Mitt Romney be that leader. He is the right man at the right time to be the next president of the United States.\nThank you very much. ", "Evening, folks.\nMy wife and I are people of modest means. I made my living as a professional firefighter for 27 years. It was there we met Mitt Romney and his family.\nIt's been over 30 years since we have lost our son David. The memories are still vivid and painful. But we wanted to share them with you because David's story is a part of Mitt's story, and America deserves to hear it.\nBack in the early 1970s, Mitt visited our home numerous times, with his oldest son Tagg tagging along. He was in the vanguard of our support system when we received the news that no parent is prepared to confront. You cannot measure a man's character based on the words he utters before adoring crowds during times that are happy. The true measure of a man is revealed in his actions during times of trouble, the quiet hospital room of a dying boy, with no cameras and no reporters.\nThis is the time to make that assessment.\nIn 1979 a tragedy struck our family when our youngest son, David, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, a \u2014 it was a cancer.Over a period of seven months he was in and out of Children's Hospital in Boston for treatment. Throughout that agonizing period, Mitt took time from his busy schedule to visit David. They developed a loving friendship. On one of his visits, Mitt discovered that David was very fond of fireworks. He went out and bought a box full of big-time fireworks that had to sit on the closet shelf because they couldn't be set off in the city. We waited until we were able to go to Ogunquit, Maine, where we set them off on the sand dunes, with permission from the fire and police departments. \nThrough that simple but thoughtful gift, Mitt brought joy to a young boy who had experienced any \u2014 had not experienced any for too long. He also gave the rest of us a welcome relief. On another visit, David, knowing Mitt had gone to law school at Harvard, asked Mitt if he would help him write a will. He had some prized possessions he wanted to make sure were given to his closest friends and family.\nThe next time Mitt went to the hospital, he was equipped with his yellow legal pad and pen. Together, they made David's will. That is a task that no child should ever have to do, but it gave David peace of mind.\nSo after David's death, we were able to give his skateboard, his model rockets and his fishing gear to his best friends. He also made it clear that his brother Peter should get his Ruger 22 rifle.\nHow many men do you know would take the time out of their busy lives to visit a terminally ill 14-year-old and help him settle his affairs?\nDavid also helped us plan his funeral. He wanted to be buried in his Boy Scout uniform. He wanted Mitt to pronounce his eulogy, and Mitt was there to honor that request.\nWe will be ever grateful to Mitt for his love and concern. We humbly wish that God will continue to bless Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan in their efforts. In doing so, he will bless the United States of America. In 1982, my husband, Grant, and I moved from California to Massachusetts with our newborn son. Being a church- going family, we looked for the nearest chapel and soon found ourselves in a congregation led by a clearly bright and capable man named Mitt Romney.\nI knew Mitt was special from the start.\nAt the time, we didn't own a dryer, and the day he stopped by to welcome us, I was embarrassed to have laundry hanging all over the house. But Mitt wasn't fazed. In fact, as we spoke, without a word, he joined me and actually started helping, helpfully plucking clothes from around the house and folding them. By the time Mitt left, not only did I feel welcome, my laundry was done. \nAs Grant and I juggled school, jobs, church and family, we grew to love the Romneys. They became role models and friends, and we were honored when Mitt and Ann regularly trusted us to stay with their five rambunctious but very loving sons when they traveled. It was when our daughter Kate was born three and a half months early, however, that I fully came to appreciate what a great treasure of friendship we had in Mitt and Ann.\nKate was so tiny and very sick, her lungs not yet ready to breathe, her heart unstable. And after suffering a severe brain hemorrhage at three days old, she was teetering on the very edge of life.\nAs I sat with her in intensive care, consumed with a mother's worry and fear, dear Mitt came to visit and pray with me. As our clergy, he was one of very few visitors allowed. And I will never forget how when he looked down tenderly at my daughter, his eyes filled with tears and he reached out and gently stroked her tiny back.\nI could tell immediately that he didn't just see a tangle of plastic in tubes and wires. He saw our beautiful little girl. And he was clearly overcome with compassion for her.\nDuring the many months that our Kate was hospitalized, the Romneys often cared for our 2-year-old son Peter. They treated him like one of their own, like a sick son. They gave him a nickname and even welcomed him to stay the night when needed.\nWhen Thanksgiving rolled around, Kate was still struggling for life. Brain surgery was scheduled, and the holiday was the furthest thing from our minds. But that morning I opened my door to find Mitt and his boys, arms loaded down with a Thanksgiving feast. Of course, we were overcome. When I called to thank Ann later, she sweetly confessed it had been Mitt's idea that most of the shopping and cooking and chopping had been done by him. She and the boys had just happily pitched in.\nEventually we moved from Boston. Our daughter Kate grew into an amazing girl of faith and love. But complications of her birth remained with her. And after 26 years of both miracles and struggle, she passed away just a year and a half ago.\nIn the midst of making the final decision to run for president, which had to be the most difficult of their lives, when they heard of Kate's passing, both Mitt and Ann paused to personally reach out to us and extend us sympathy and express their love. It seems to me when it comes to loving our neighbor, we can talk about it, or we can live it.\nThe Romneys live it every single day. \nWhen the world looks at Mitt Romney, they may see him as the founder of a successful business, the leader of the Olympic Games or a governor. But when I see Mitt Romney, I know him to be a loving father, a man of faith and a caring and compassionate friend. It is with great excitement and renewed hope that I think of how our country will be blessed as it is led by a man who is not only so very accomplished and capable, but who has devoted his entire life quietly serving others. That man is Mitt Romney. ", "I have been blessed to spend thousands of hours over many years with a dear friend and remarkable man named Mitt Romney. These wonderful, even glorious, hours together were spent in serving our fellow men and women. They were spent in service in our church. \nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, of which we are members, has an unpaid lay clergy.\nWhile raising his family and pursuing his career, Mitt Romney served in our church, devoting 10, 15 and even 20 hours a week doing so. Like all Mormon leaders, he did so on his own time and at his own expense. \nI was Mitt's assistant when he was our pastor. I had a front-row seat, and it was marvelous to behold. As we began working together, Mitt asked, how early can I call you in the morning? I answered, 6:00 a.m. I regret my answer. Mitt Romney became my alarm clock.\nA typical morning call: Grant, it's Mitt. I'm at the airport. Hazel Young tripped last night and bruised her hip. Please visit her this evening. Give her my love. I'll arrange for meals, and I will visit her on my way home from the airport tomorrow.\nIn our early morning calls, Mitt didn't discuss questions of theology. He found the definition of religion given by James in the New Testament to be a practical guide. Pure religion is to visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction. \nSo what specifically did Mitt Romney do as our pastor? For one or two evenings each week and several hours every weekend, week after week and year after year, he met with those seeking help with the burdens of real life, burdens we all face at one time or another: unemployment, sickness, financial distress, loneliness.\nMitt prayed and counseled with church members seeking spiritual direction: single mothers raising children, couples with marital problems, youth with addictions, immigrants separated from their families and individuals whose heat had been shut off. To uphold the dignity and respect the privacy of those who came, he met with them in private and in confidence. He has upheld that trust. \nMitt's response to those who came was compassion in all its beautiful varieties. He had a listening ear and a helping hand. Drawing on the skills and resources of those in our congregation, Mitt provided food and housing, rides to the doctor and companions to sit with those who were ill. He shoveled snow and raked leaves for the elderly. He took down tables and swept floors at church dinners. He was often the last to leave.\nYears later I became the pastor.\nOnly then did I understand the dedication this calling requires and the clarity this service provides into the full range of our shared human experience. Mitt challenged each of us to find our life by losing it in service to others. He issued that challenge again and again. \nThe church itself was a marvelous vehicle for extending that challenge. Mitt seldom delivered the sermon himself; he gave that opportunity to fellow church members. He sought to involve everyone so everyone could grow. Mitt taught faith in God, personal integrity, self-reliance and service to our fellow men. \nI treasure every minute we serve together. I am grateful for my apprenticeship in the things that matter most under the hands of a deeply good man named Mitt Romney. \nIt is my privilege to introduce two families from our congregation: first, Pat and Ted Oparowsky. They will be followed by Pam Finlayson. ", "Thank you. Thank you all very much. \nBefore I begin my remarks, I have something personal I'd like to share with you. I've been so blessed to be part of a family that has committed its life to public service. My granddad \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0my grandfather and my father have been incredible role models for me and served our country honorably.\nAnd my brother? Well, I love my brother. \nSo Mr. President \u2014\u00a0Mr. President, it is time to stop blaming your predecessor for your failed economic policies. You were dealt a tough hand. You were dealt a tough hand, but your policies have not worked. In the fourth year of your presidency, a real leader would accept responsibility for his actions, and you haven't done it.\nNow \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0now that I've gotten that off of my chest, let's talk a little bit about our kids and education.\nThis election is about the future of this nation. We can shape that future with what we do here, with what we do on November 6th. We can restore America's greatness. That starts with a strong economy, a smart energy policy, lower deficits and a president who puts America's workers and job creators first.\nBut to have a great future, a secure future, a future that is equal to our potential as a nation, we need to do something else.\nWe must make sure that our children and grandchildren are ready for the world we are shaping today. It starts \u2014\u00a0it starts in our homes, in our communities and especially in our schools.\nAs a candidate and governor, I visited over 400 Florida schools. I saw children read for their first sentences, solve their first long division problems, explore the miracles of chemistry and physics. That's the essence of education: students getting a chance at a future.\nThere are many reasons to believe America's future is bright, but also reasons to worry. Of 34 advanced nations in the world, American students rank 17th in science, 25th in math. Only one quarter of high school graduates are ready for their next steps. China and India produce eight times more engineering students each years than the United States. This is a moral cost to our country. Our failing schools need to be fixed. \nWe say that every child in America has an equal opportunity. But tell that to a kid in whose classroom learning isn't respected. Tell that to a parent stuck in a school where there is no leadership. Tell that to a young talented teacher who just got laid off because she didn't have tenure. The sad truth is that equality of opportunity doesn't exist in many of our schools. We give some kids a chance, but not all. That failure is the great moral and economic issue of our time, and it is hurting all of America. \nI believe we can meet this challenge. We need to set high standards for students and teachers, and provide students and their parents the choices they deserve.\nThe first step is a simple one. We must stop prejudging children based on their race, ethnicity or household income. We must have high academic standards that are benchmarked to the best in the world.\nYou see, all kids can learn. Governor Romney believes it, and the data proves it. While he was governor, Massachusetts raised standards, and today their students lead the nation in academic performance. \nHere in Florida, in 1999 we were at the bottom of the nation in education. For the last decade the state has been on a path of reform. Under the leadership of Governor Rick Scott and local leaders, our focus every day is whether students are learning. That's it. \nToday more students are reading on grade level, passing rigorous college prep courses and graduating from high school. And perhaps most exciting, those traditionally left behind are showing the greatest gains. Among African-American students, Florida is ranked fourth in the nation for academic improvement. Among low-income students \u2014\u00a0\nThese kids \u2014\u00a0these kids were once written off. But today, thanks to teachers like Sean Duffy, we're changing that.\nI'm honored to be an educator, to help the next generation of leaders, thinkers, builders and entrepreneurs. Sadly, I'm part of a dwindling field. I've seen too many good teachers come and go, mainly due to poor working conditions and little pay. Bad teachers get locked into the system, and good teachers leave for more money.\nOn top of the bureaucratic challenges, what we're teaching doesn't always match what our students actually need. To that end, I helped launch a STEM lab at my high school. These labs focus on science, technology, engineering and mathematics and help students learn proficiency in these fields.\nWe turn students away from education each year by not providing a robust curriculum that helps keep \u2014\u00a0that keeps up with the world in which these students live and will eventually work. And at the end of the day, all of what we do, from the educators to the policymakers, has to be student-focused and student-centered. After all, students matter most, and that's what counts.\nThank you. Thank you, Sean. I know that Del Valle High School is proud of your efforts, and we need more great teachers like you, teachers who don't give up on a kid, who recognize that every child can learn and don't waste a precious year of a student's life. If you're a great teacher and your students are mastering their subjects, no matter your age or years of experience, you should have a job. Education is hard work, but if you follow some core principles and you challenge the status quo, you can get great results.\nSo here's another thing we could do: Let's give every parent in America a choice about where their child's \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0attends school.\nLook \u2014\u00a0\nGovernor Romney gets it. Mitt Romney gets it. He believes parents, regardless of zip code or income, should be able to send their child to the school that fits them best. That has set him up against some entrenched interests. There are many people who say they support strong schools but draw the line at school choice. Sorry, kid, giving you equal opportunity would be too risky, and it would upset powerful political forces that we need to win elections. I have a simple message for these masters of delay and deferral: Choose. You can either help the politically powerful unions, or you can help the kids. \nNow, for those that have been involved in this, you know it's hard to take on the unions. They fund campaigns. They're well- organized. Election day, they'll show up.\nMeanwhile, the kids aren't old enough to vote. But you and I know who deserves a choice. Governor Romney knows it, too.\nLet me introduce you to Frantz Placide. Because we gave him a choice, he got a great election. I grew up in the inner city of Miami, in a place where your ZIP code determines your chances of success. My only option was an unproductive and failing school. I knew that could lead to an unproductive and failing future.\nThank to Governor Bush's school choice program, I got the chance to choose a better school. Making my education my priority, I enrolled at one of the toughest high schools in Miami, Archbishop Curley Notre Dame. \nI'm sure, like a lot of us, it was my mother Carlette \nWho knows what the future would have held if I didn't have a choice in my education? But I do know the numbers for failure, and I probably wouldn't have a good chance.\nGovernor Bush's school choice program gave me a chance to achieve academic success in a school that was best-fit for me. I took it from there. Thank you. Thank you, Frantz. It is an incredible honor to see you grow up. And Frantz's story is \u2014\u00a0and many others \u2014\u00a0is a driving force across this nation to bring about necessary change.\nAnd some of the biggest reformers are Republicans. Governor Mitch Daniels in Indiana and Bobby Jindal in Louisiana have expanded school choice from what we have here in Florida. \nGovernor Scott Walker in Wisconsin led his state \u2014\u00a0\nBecause he is a former governor, Mitt Romney understands that states must lead this national movement. In Massachusetts \u2014\u00a0He is a champion for bringing hope to education, and he intends to be a champion for equality of opportunity \u2014\u00a0a president who always puts students first.\nSo in this election, remember this: Our future as a nation is at stake. Fact is this election is not just about one office; it's about one nation. If we want to continue to be the greatest nation on the planet, we must give our kids what we promise them: an equal opportunity. That starts in the classroom. It starts in our communities. It starts where you live. And it starts with electing Mitt Romney the next president of the United States. \nThank you. God bless you. God bless our excellent teachers, and God bless the United States of America. ", "I am honored and humbled to speak to you tonight. I'm incredibly proud of my father, and I love him dearly.\nIt is my privilege to say a few words in Spanish, so please bear with me for a moment. Buenas noches. Es un placer estar con ustedes. Yo pase dos anios \u2014\u00a0aun mas como hispanos han aportado a la diversa riqueza de los Estados Unidos.\nMi padre, Mitt Romney, es un hombre de familia. El es un gran esposo, padre y abuelo. El sabe como unir a nuestro pais y valora que somos una nacion de inmigrantes unidos en el deseo de lograr el suenio americano. El ama a nuestra nacion. El luchara para confrontar los retos que tenemos y restaurar la grandeza de los Estados Unidos.\nIt's easy to forget \u2014\u00a0It's easy to forget that the story of my father's success begins with the story of two immigrants. Thank you.\n\nMy grandfathers, who came to this country with little more than hope and the opportunity of America, through their hard work and perseverance, they lived the American dream. They gave opportunities to their children they wouldn't have had anywhere else. The Republican Party is dedicated to preserving that opportunity for all Americans. \nWe've had the privilege of hearing about different chapters of the same inspiring story from Governors Sandoval and Martinez and soon-to-be Senator Cruz. We're seeing this story play out in the lives of many other Hispanic-Americans who have become leaders in the Republican party and throughout our nation. These leaders, along with Hispanics across the country, play a vital role in the Romney-Ryan comeback as we fight to put America back on the path to prosperity.\nThank you. ", "Thank you. Thank you for that warm welcome. What a wonderful tribute to President Reagan and the spirit of the American people.It's fantastic to see so many friends here, friends from decades of service to the party, service in public life and those who have helped us over the past few years. And we are delighted that tonight we come together to once again renew the American spirit and put real leadership back in the White House this November.\nThe election of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will decisively move America to a better future. Remembering President Reagan reminds us that the choices we make matter. And this year is as important as the choice we made in 1980.Over three decades have passed since Ronald Reagan was first elected to the White House. Yet the impact of his leadership is still evident today. While in office, President Reagan had three major goals: to restore the economy, to revive the American spirit and to defeat totalitarianism, spreading democracy throughout the world.By remaining true to his convictions through his belief in the American people and with tremendous optimism, President Reagan achieved these goals.It's striking how President Carter and President Obama both took our nation down a path that in four years weakened America's confidence in itself and our hope for a better future.Both weakened the respect for America abroad. Both increased government programs filled with waste and inefficiency that failed to produce results. Both made promises they couldn't keep. And as a consequence of ineffective policies, both were unable to revive our economy and create jobs.For example, both crippled American energy production when there were better ways to develop and use our abundant energy resources.\nThe Romney plan for North American energy independence is exactly the kind of bold visionary leadership Reagan believed in, and it is what we need now. The Reagan presidency also teaches us that there is a better way to put Americans back to work, create millions of jobs and help every American achieve success. The Reagan program of tax cuts, regulatory reform and spending controls worked.Reagan's belief in small business owners and entrepreneurs is a remarkable contrast with Obama's class warfare rhetoric, massive deficits and a passion for taxing those who create jobs. The Romney plan for a stronger middle class has deep roots in Ronald Reagan's approach.Reagan's commitment to reform welfare and to create a work requirement was a major achievement when he was governor of California. His pioneering work led to the historic welfare reform bill Congress and the president passed 30 years later. This bipartisan legislation reduced the size of government, made our country more competitive and put millions of Americans back to work. Tragically, President Obama gutted this achievement, and like Jimmy Carter, over four years he produced little effective legislation that brought the two parties together in the interest of the nation.\nObama's waiving of the work requirements in welfare reform is just one example of his direct repudiation of President Reagan's values.\nObama's proud of what he's done, and of his politically motivated partisanship. But he should be ashamed for putting politics before people. Governor Romney will return America to work and to the principles that are at the core of President Reagan's legacy. This year the American people will once again have an important choice to make.Now each of us must commit ourselves, in the tradition of Ronald Reagan, to come together. President Reagan said there is no substitute for victory. And this November we cannot settle for anything less. This \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0this is the most critical election of our lifetime. Each of us must do our part now to ensure that America remains, in the tradition of President Reagan, a land of freedom, hope and opportunity.\nThank you, and God bless you, and God bless America. ", "Once again it's morning in America.\nThere are new leaders on the horizon: Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, America's comeback team. \nGrowing up, I had a plaque on my wall that read: Life's battles don't always go to the fastest or the strongest. Sooner or later those who win are those who think they can. We've always been a people with big dreams and limitless potential. After all, this is America. \nOur success is built on our values and our principles. But so many of them are under attack. Our commitment to freedom and liberty and to everything that makes our country great seems to embarrass the \"blame America first\" crowd. They penalize individual achievement, praising the power of government, but they have not, cannot and will not destroy our spirit. \nWe are proud to be Americans, we are proud of our nation, we are proud of our heritage, and we are proud of our success. It is our commitment to the American story. It's our athletes in London who brought home more medals than any other country, even China. It's our best and our brightest who landed an extraordinary rover on Mars. It's Nobel Prize winners, scientists, writers, artists second to none who inspire us all. These are the achievements that are brought about by a free society that honors individual effort.\nWe owe it to those who have given so much to regain our strength and remain the strongest force for freedom the world has ever seen.\nOur allies deserve an unwavering support. And our enemies need to know we stand to defend freedom at all costs. \nAmerica was built on the belief in free enterprise, hard work, passion and faith. We have the awesome responsibility to make that dream a reality. That dream is not an impossible dream. It's the American dream. It's sure, it's strong and it's steady.\nMitt Romney's plans to restore America's promise and purpose will be realized, and the American dream will once again be available to all her children. We are a nation of dreamers \u2014\u00a0Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, the Wright Brothers, dreamers like Neil Armstrong who sought new lands and took giant leaps into American exceptionalism, and dreamers like my friend Kiko Villalon. You know the stories of the other. Now let me tell you the story of Kiko.\nIn 1960, Kiko fled Castro's Cuba. He came to New York. He became a taxi driver. He worked hard and saved his money. He became a citizen. He moved to Florida. He started a business building boats. He raised a family. He put his children through school. He sold his business. Now he worries about what opportunities lie ahead for his children and their children.\nKiko has lived the American dream, as have so many others.\nThat's what this election is all about: making the American dream a reality again. \nIt's not about the past. It's not about what was done wrong. It's not about blaming America. It's quite the opposite. Tonight we embark on a renewal of the American dream. Tonight we honor those who have come before and done so much, many even giving their lives. And tonight we honor our children and their children, to ensure their dreams, whether it's playing under the lights or starting a business or being a doctor or a nurse or a soldier or a sailor or even a president or vice president. Dreams can come \u2014\u00a0become realities. After all, this is America, and it's morning once again.\nThank you. ", "Hello, everybody. Hello, everybody. Thank you.\nMr. Chairman \u2014\u00a0Mr. Chairman, delegates and fellow citizens, I am honored by the support of this convention for vice president of the United States. \nI accept the duty to help lead our nation out of a jobs crisis and back to prosperity. And I know we can do this. \nI accept the calling of my generation to give our children the America that was given to us, with opportunity for the young and security for the old. And I know that we are ready. Our nominee is sure ready. \nI'm the newcomer to this campaign. So let me share a first impression. I have never seen opponents so silent about their record and so desperate to keep their power. They've run out of ideas. Their moment came and went. Fear and division is all they've got left. With all their attack ads, the president is just throwing away money. And he's pretty experienced at that. \nYou see, some people can't be dragged down by the usual cheap tactics because their character, ability and plain decency are so obvious.\n\nFor my part, your nomination is an unexpected turn. It certainly came as news to my family. \nThe kids are happy to see their grandma who lives in Florida. There she is, my mom Betty. \nMy dad, a small-town lawyer, was also named Paul. Until we lost him when I was 16, he was a gentle presence in my life. I'd like to think he'd be proud of me and my sister and brothers. \nYou know what? I'm sure proud of him and where I come from: Janesville, Wisconsin. \nI live on the same block where I grew up. We belong to the same parish where I was baptized. Janesville is that kind of place. The people of Wisconsin have been good to me. I've tried to live up to their trust. And now, I ask those hardworking men and women and millions like them across America to join our cause and get this country working again.\n\nPresident Barack Obama came to office during an economic crisis, as he has reminded us a time or two. Those were very tough days, and any fair measure of his record has to take that into account. My own state voted for President Obama. When he talked about change, many people liked the sound of it, especially in Janesville, where we were about to lose a major factory. A lot of guys I went to high school with worked at that GM plant. Right there at that plant, Candidate Obama said, I believe that if our government is there to support you, this plant will be here for another hundred years. That's what he said in 2008.\nWell, as it turned out, that plant didn't last another year. It is locked up and empty to this day. And that's how it is in so many towns, where the recovery that was promised is nowhere in sight. Right now, 23 million men and women are struggling to find work, 23 million people unemployed or underemployed. Nearly 1-in-6 Americans is in poverty.\nMillions of young Americans have graduated from college during the Obama presidency, ready to use their gifts and get moving in life. Half of them can't find the work they studied for or any work at all. So here's the question: Without a change in leadership, why would the next four years be any different from the last four years? \nThe first troubling sign came with the stimulus. It was President Obama's first and best shot at fixing the economy at a time when he got \u2014\u00a0he got everything he wanted under one-party rule. It cost $831 billion, the largest one-time expenditure every by our federal government. It went to companies like Solyndra, with their gold-plated connections, subsidized jobs and make-believe markets. The stimulus was a case of political patronage, corporate welfare and cronyism at their worst.You, you the American people of this country, were cut out of the deal. What did taxpayers get out of the Obama stimulus? More debt. That money wasn't just spent and wasted. It was borrowed, spent and wasted. \nMaybe the greatest waste of all was time.\nHere we were, faced with a massive job crisis so deep that if everyone out of work stood in single file, that unemployment line would stretch the length of the entire American continent. You would think that any president, whatever his party, would make job creation and nothing else his first order of economic business. But this president didn't do that. Instead we got a long, divisive, all-or- nothing attempt to put the federal government in charge of health care. \nYou know what, the president has declared that the debate over government-controlled health care is over. That will come as news to the millions of Americans who will elect Mitt Romney so we can repeal \"Obamacare.\" \nAnd the biggest, coldest power play of all in \"Obamacare\" came at the expense of the elderly. You see, even with all the hidden taxes to pay for the health care takeover, even with the new law and new taxes on nearly a small businesses, the planners in Washington still didn't have enough money. They needed more. They needed hundreds of billions more. So they just took it all away from Medicare \u2014\u00a0$716 billion funneled out of Medicare by President Obama. \nThe greatest threat to Medicare is \"Obamacare,\" and we're going to stop it. \nIn Congress, when they take out the heavy books and the wall charts about Medicare, my thoughts go back to a house on Garfield Street in Janesville. My wonderful grandma, Janet \nSo our opponents can consider themselves on notice. In this election, on this issue, the usual posturing on the left isn't going to work. Mitt Romney and I know the difference between protecting a program and raiding it. Ladies and gentlemen, our nation needs this debate. We want this debate. We will win this debate! \n\"Obamacare,\" as much as anything else, explains why a presidency that we \u2014\u00a0that began with such anticipation now comes to such a disappointing close. It began with a financial crisis. It ends with a job crisis. It began with a housing crisis they alone didn't cause. It ends with a housing crisis they didn't correct. \nIt all started off with stirring speeches, Greek columns, the thrill of something new. Now all that's left is a presidency adrift, surviving on slogans that already seem tired, grasping at a moment that has already passed, like a ship trying to sail on yesterday's wind. \nYou know, President Obama was asked not long ago to reflect on any mistakes he might have made. He said, well, I haven't communicated enough. \nAnd the story \u2014\u00a0and the story that Barack Obama does tell, forever shifting blame to the last administration, is getting old.\n\nIn this generation, a defining responsibility of government is to steer our nation clear of a debt crisis while there is still time. Back in 2008 Candidate Obama called a $10 trillion national debt unpatriotic \u2014\u00a0serious talk from what looked like a serious reformer. Yet by his own decisions, President Obama has added more debt than any other president before him and more than all the troubled governments of Europe combined. One president, one term, 5 trillion \nHe created a new bipartisan debt commission. They came back with an urgent report. He thanked them, sent them on their way and then did exactly nothing. Republicans \u2014\u00a0Republicans stepped up with good faith reforms and solutions equal to the problems. How did the president respond? By doing nothing \u2014\u00a0nothing except to dodge and demagogue the issue. So here we are, $16 trillion in debt, and still he does nothing. In Europe massive debts have put entire governments at risk of collapse, and still he does nothing. And all we have heard from this president and his team are attacks on anyone who dares to point out the obvious. They have no answer to this simple reality.\nWe need to stop spending money we don't have. \nMy dad used to say to me, son, you have a choice. You can be part of the problem, or you can be part of the solution. The present administration has made its choices, and Mitt Romney and I have made ours. Before the math and the momentum overwhelm us all, we are going to solve this nation's economic problems. \nAnd I'm going to level with you: we don't have that much time. But if we are serious and smart, and we lead, we can do this. After four years of government trying to divide up the wealth, we will get America creating wealth again. With tax fairness and regulatory reform, we'll put government back on the side of men and women who create jobs and the men and women who need jobs.\nMy mom started a small business, and I've seen what it takes. Mom was 50 when my dad died. She got on a bus every weekday for years and rode 40 miles each morning to Madison.\nShe earned a new degree and learned new skills to start her small business. It wasn't just a new livelihood; it was a new life. And it transformed my mom from a widow in grief to a small-business woman whose happiness wasn't just in the past. Her work gave her hope. It made our family proud. And to this day my mom is my role model. \nBehind every small business, there's a story worth knowing. All the corner shops in our towns and cities, the restaurants, cleaners, gyms, hair salons, hardware stores \u2014\u00a0these didn't come out of nowhere. A lot of heart goes into each one. And if small-business people say they made it on their own, all they are saying is that nobody else works seven days a week in their place. Nobody showed up in their place to open the door at 5:00 in the morning. Nobody did their thinking and worrying and sweating for them.\nAfter all that work and in a bad economy, it sure doesn't help to hear from their president that government gets the credit. What they deserve to hear is the truth: Yes, you did build that. \nWe have a plan for a stronger middle class, with a goal of generating 12 million new jobs over the next four years. \nThe choice \u2014\u00a0the choice is whether to put hard limits on economic growth or hard limits on the size of government, and we choose to limit government. \nI learned a good deal about economics and about America from the author of the Reagan tax reforms, the great Jack Kemp. What gave Jack that incredible enthusiasm was his belief in the possibilities of free people and the power of free enterprise and strong communities to overcome poverty and despair. We need that same optimism right now.\nAnd in our dealings with other nations, a Romney-Ryan administration will speak with confidence and clarity. Whenever men and women rise up for their own freedom, they will know that the American president is on their side. \nInstead \u2014\u00a0instead of managing American decline, leaving allies to doubt us and adversaries to test us, we will act in the conviction that the United States is still the greatest force for peace and liberty that this world has ever known. President Obama is the kind of politician who puts promises on the record and then \nCollege graduates should not have to live out their 20s in their childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life. \nEveryone \u2014\u00a0everyone who feels stuck in the Obama economy is right to focus on the here and now.\nAnd I hope you understand this too. If you're feeling left out or passed by, you have not failed. Your leaders have failed you. \nListen to the way we're already spoken to. \nYou know, when I was waiting tables, washing dishes or mowing lawns for money, I never thought of myself as stuck in some station in life. I was on my own path, my own journey, an American journey, where I could think for myself, decide for myself, define happiness for myself. That's what we do in this country. By themselves \u2014\u00a0by themselves, the failures of one administration are not a mandate for a new administration.\nA challenger must stand on his own merits. He must be ready and worthy to serve in the office of president. We're a full generation apart, Governor Romney and I, and in some ways we're different. There are the songs on his iPod, which I've heard on the campaign bus \u2014\u00a0\nLook, a generation apart \u2014\u00a0a generation apart, but that doesn't matter. It makes us different, but not in any of the things that matter. Mitt Romney and I both grew up in the heartland, and we know what places like Wisconsin and Michigan look like \u2014\u00a0We know what these communities look like when times are good, when people are working, when families are doing more than just getting by. And we know it can be that way again.\nWe've had very different careers, mine mainly in public services, his mostly in the private sector. He helped start businesses and turn around failing ones. And by the way, being successful in business, that's a good thing. \nMitt \u2014\u00a0Mitt has not only succeeded, but he succeeded where others could not. He turned around the Olympics at a time when a great institution was collapsing under the weight of bad management, overspending and corruption. Sounds kind of familiar, doesn't it? \nMitt and I also go to different churches. But in any church, the best kind of preaching is done by example. And I've been watching that example. \u2014\u00a0worthy of leading this optimistic and good-hearted country.\nOur faiths come together in the same moral creed. We believe that in every life, there is goodness; for every person, there is hope. Each one of us was made for a reason, bearing the image and likeness of the lord of life. \nWe have responsibilities, one to another. We do not each face the world alone. And the greatest of all responsibilities is that of the strong to protect the weak. The truest measure of any society is how it treats those who cannot defend or care for themselves. \nEach of these moral ideas \u2014\u00a0each of these moral ideas is essential to democratic government, to the rule of law, to life in a humane and decent society. They are the moral creed of our country, as powerful in our time as on the day of America's founding. They are self-evident and unchanging. And sometimes even presidents need reminding that our rights come from nature and God and not from government! \nThe founding generation secured those rights for us. And in every generation since, the best among us have defended our freedoms. They are protecting us right now. We honor them and all of our veterans, and we thank them. \nThe right that makes all the difference now is the right to choose our own leaders. And you are entitled to the clearest possible choice, because the time for choosing is drawing near.\nSo here is our pledge. We will not duck the tough issues. We will lead. We will not spend four years blaming others. We will take responsibility. \nThe work ahead will be hard. These times demand the best of all of us \u2014\u00a0all of us, but we can do this. We can do this. Together we can do this. We can get this country working again. We can get this economy growing again. \nThank you, and God bless you all. Thank you. ", "Thank you, and good evening. Before I begin tonight, let's keep in our prayers the families impacted by the storm affecting the Gulf Coast. If you haven't done so already, please donate to the Red Cross. To find out more about how you can help those affected by Hurricane Isaac, please visit redcross.org/give.\nI am Susana Martinez. On behalf of the great state of New Mexico, let me express my gratitude for being invited to speak tonight. Growing up, I never imagined a little girl from a border town could one day become a governor. But this is America. En America, todo es posible. \nMy parents taught me to never give up and to always believe that my future could be whatever I dreamt it to be. Success, they taught me, is built on the foundation of courage, hard work and individual responsibility. Despite what some would have us believe, success is not built on resentment and fear. \nWe grew up on the border and truly lived paycheck to paycheck. My dad was a Golden Gloves boxer in the Marine Corps, then a deputy sheriff. \nMy parents grew that small business from one 18-year-old guarding a bingo to more than 125 employees in three states. \nAnd sure, there was help along the way. But my parents took the risk. They stood up. And you better believe they built it. \nMy parents also taught me about having the courage to stand for something. So I went to law school and I became a prosecutor. I took on a speciality that very few choose to pursue. I prosecuted child abuse and child homicide cases \u2014\u00a0cases that were truly gut-wrenching. But standing up for those kids, being their voice for justice, was the honor of a lifetime. \nSometimes you pay a price for standing up. When I was a young prosecutor, I got called to testify against my boss. I could have backed down, but I didn't. I stood up to him. And he fired me for it. So I took him on, ran against him for district attorney and beat him by a landslide. \nI fear some of our leaders today have lost the courage to stand up. That we have now \u2014\u00a0what we have now are politicians. They won't offer real plans, and only stand up when they want to blame someone else. And I don't say that just because a Democrat is in the White House.\nI was a Democrat for many years. So were my parents.\nBefore I ran for district attorney, two Republicans invited my husband and me to lunch, and I knew a party switch was exactly what they wanted. So I told Chuck, we'll be polite, enjoy a free lunch and then say goodbye. But we talked about issues. They never used the words \"Republican\" or \"Democrat,\" \"conservative\" or \"liberal.\" We talked about many issues, like welfare. Is it a way of life or a hand up? Talked about the size of government. How much should it tax families and small businesses? And when we left that lunch, we got in the car, and I looked over at Chuck and said, I'll be damned; we're Republicans. \nThis election should not be about political parties. Too many Americans are out of work, and our debt is out of control. This election needs to be about those issues. And it is the responsibility of both parties to offer up real solutions and have an honest debate. In New Mexico, I inherited the largest structural deficit in state history. And our legislature is controlled by Democrats. We don't always agree, but we came together in a bipartisan manner and turned that deficit into a surplus.\nBut that's not the kind of leadership that we are seeing from President Obama. He promised to bring us all together, to cut unemployment, to pass immigration reform in his first year and even promised to cut the deficit in half in his first term. Do you remember that?But he hasn't come close. They haven't even passed a budget in Washington, D.C. in three years. \nAs the first Hispanic female governor in the history, little girls, they often come up to me in the grocery store or in the mall. They look, and they point, and when they get the courage to come up, they ask, are you Susana? And they run up and they give me a hug. And I wonder, how do you know who I am?\nBut they do, and these are little girls.\nIt's in moments like these when I'm reminded that we each pave a path, and for me, it's about paving a path for those little girls to follow. They need to know: No more barriers. \nIn many ways, Mitt Romney and I are very different \u2014\u00a0different starts in life, different paths to leadership, different cultures. But we've each shared in the promise of America. And we share a core belief that the promise of America must be kept for the next generation. \"El sueno americano es tener exito.\" Is success \u2014\u00a0it is success, and success is the American dream. And that success is not something to be ashamed of or to demonize.\nThere is one candidate in this election who will protect that dream, one leader who will fight hard to keep the promise of America for the next generation. And that's why we must stand up and make Mitt Romney the next president of the United States. Thank you.", "Thank you. Thank you very much. I was so very honored to be asked to address one of this week's themes: We can do better. And then I was backstage and I heard some folks say that after hearing me speak, the delegates are going to say: We sure can do better than Huckabee. \nI want to say that Tampa has been a wonderful and hospitable city, and I'm grateful for all that they've done for us. But the only hitch in an otherwise perfect week was the awful noise coming from the hotel room next door to mine. Turns out, it was just Debbie Wasserman Schultz practicing her speech for the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte next week, bless her heart.\n\nFour years ago Mitt Romney and I were opponents. We still are. But we're not opposing each other. No, we are mutual opponents of the miserably failed experiments that have put this country in a downward spiral. The United States of America was originally an experiment. But it was an experiment in recognizing God-given individual liberty and creating a government in which no one is deemed better than another and in which all of us are equal, not equal in abilities but equal in intrinsic worth and value. It is the essence not just of who we are but what we are.\nNow, let me just say, to those who question how once-rivals can be now united, it's quite simple. We have Barack Obama to thank. \nFor four years we've given a chance to a man with very limited experience in governing, no experience in business whatsoever and, since taking office, mostly in \u2014\u00a0interested in campaigning, blaming and aiming excuses at his predecessor, the Republicans and people in business or, as Republicans like to call them, employers.\nWe've stagnated into an economy that has taken all that hope right down the slope and left millions without jobs, forced out of their homes by foreclosure, herded into dependency upon a government that promises us candy but gives us cavities.\nBarack Obama seems intent on enrolling more people on food stamps. Mitt Romney's focus is going to be on generating more jobs that will make food stamps unnecessary for them. \nMitt Romney turned around companies that were on the skids. He turned around a scandal-ridden Olympics that was deep in the red, into high point of profit and patriotic pride. And he turned around a very liberal state when he erased a deficit and replaced it with a surplus.\nDo you remember when Barack Obama said that if couldn't turn things around in three years, it would be a one-term proposition? \nI understand that the job of president is admittedly tougher than running a company, an Olympic contest or a commonwealth. But when one sees what even Bill Clinton noted was a sterling record of problem- solving that has marked the life of Mitt Romney, we are confident that we will do better.\nHe \u2014\u00a0he's been loyal to his sons, to his country, to his employees and to his church.\nWell, I'm sure now that the press is going to tell you he isn't perfect. But my friends, for the past four years, we tried the one that the press thought was perfect, and that hasn't worked out all that well for us. \u2014\u00a0we can do better.\nOur Founding Fathers left taxation and tyranny, seeking religious liberty and a society of meritocracy rather than aristocracy. What they created was a bold experiment in government, believing that God gave us unalienable rights and that the role of government is simply to make sure that those rights are protected.\nSo fearful were they that the government would grow beyond their intention that even after crafting our magnificent Constitution, they said, we can do even better. They added amendments. We call them the Bill of Rights. Those Bill of Rights limit what the government can do, and they guarantee what we the people have the unimpeded right to do, whether to speak, assemble, worship, pray, publish or even refuse intrusions into our homes.\nMany of those founders died to pass on that heritage. They had lived under the boot of big government. And what they said was: We can do better. \nAs a kid growing up in a household, my dad never finished high school. I grew up in a family in which no male upstream from me had ever finished high school, much less gone to college. But I was taught that even though there was nothing I could do about what was behind me, I could change everything about what was in front of me.\nMy working-poor parents told me that I could do better. They taught me I was as good as anybody else. And it never occurred to them to tell me that I could just rest comfortably and wait for good old \"Uncle Sugar\" to feed me, lead me and then bleed me. They told me to get off my backside, work hard, take risks and treat people honestly and honorably.\nAnd look at me today. I've become, as the press like to label me, a failed candidate. Oh, it's true. I have fallen from the high perch of politics and now I wallow in the mud of the media. \nI want to clear the air about something that has been said. People wonder whether guys like me, an evangelical, would only support a fellow evangelical. Well, my friends, I want to tell you something. Of the four people on the two tickets, the only self-professed evangelical is Barack Obama, and he supports changing the definition of marriage, believes that human life is disposable and expendable at any time in the womb, even beyond the womb, and he tells people of faith that they have to bow their knees to the god of government and violate their faith and conscience in order to comply with what he calls health care.\nFriends, I know we can do better. \nLet me say it as clearly as possible that the attack on my Catholic brothers and sisters is an attack on me. The Democrats have brought back that old dance, the limbo, to see how low they can go in attempting to limit our ability to practice our faith. But this isn't a battle about contraceptives and Catholics but about conscience and the Creator.\nLet me say to you tonight I care far less as to where Mitt Romney takes his family to church than I do about where he takes this country. \nJoe Biden \u2014\u00a0Joe Biden said, show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value. Well, in the Senate, Joe's party hasn't produced a budget in three years. What does that say \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0about their values?\nAnd by the way, speaking of budgets, Joe Biden's budget shows that while he wants to be very generous with your money through higher taxes and government spending, for years he gave less than two-tenths of 1 percent of his own money to charity.\nHe just wants you to give the government more so he and the Democrats can feel better about themselves. Mitt Romney has given over 16 percent of his income to church and charity. \nMy concern is not Barack Obama's past, but my concern is for the future \u2014\u00a0not his future, but for the future of my grandchildren, little Chandler and Scarlett. And under this president, we have burdened each of them with tens of thousands of dollars of debt and a system that will collapse upon itself because he thinks that we can prosper by punishing productivity and rewarding reckless irresponsibility.\nThe Democrats say we ought to give Barack Obama credit for trying. Folks, that sounds like the nonsense of giving every kid a trophy for showing up. Sometimes we get so close to the picture we really can't see it clearly.\nI've had the privilege of working with Bono for the past few years in the ONE campaign to fight AIDS and hunger and disease around the world.\nBono is an Irishman and a great humanitarian, and I remember him telling me of his admiration for America. He said, America is more than just a country. We are an idea. And he reminded me that we are an exceptional nation with an extraordinary history who owes it to the generations who are coming after us to leave them with an extraordinary legacy. But if we don't change the direction of our nation now, our bequest will be nothing but an extraordinary chain. But dear friends, we can do better. \nPresident Obama is out of gas, and Americans are out of patience. And our great republic is almost out of time. It's time that we no longer lead from behind, but that we get off our behinds and leave something lasting for those who came after us instead of a mountain of debt and a pile of excuses. Tonight \u2014\u00a0not because we're Republicans \u2014\u00a0it's because we are Americans that we proudly stand with Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, and we say, we will do better. \nGod bless you. Thank you. God bless. ", "Thank you. Thank you very much. Good evening, everyone, and welcome to Barack Obama's retirement party. \nFour years ago we came together for this convention back in my home state of Minnesota. And a lot's happened since then. We've had four years of Barack Obama in the White House. Ah, the Obama White House. One bad decision follows another.\nIt's hard to say exactly just what his worst mistake has been. There's so many to choose from: the stimulus, his energy policy, \"Obamacare,\" taxes, Joe Biden. \nNow, I hear Joe's particularly interested in tonight's proceedings. He even thought about coming here to Tampa, and he's taking notes, because when Paul Ryan speaks, Joe will finally get to hear what a real vice president sounds like. \nBut you know, President Obama isn't as bad as people say. He's actually worse. \nI've come to realize that Barack Obama is the \"tattoo president.\" Like a big tattoo, it seemed cool when we were young, but later on that decision doesn't look so good. And you wonder: What was I thinking? \nNext week Barack Obama will plead with America to give his failed policies and ideas another chance. He's asking Americans to give him more time and more money. Well, sorry, Mr. President, but you're out of time, and we're out of money. \nBarack Obama's failed us. But look, it's understandable. A lot of people fail at their first job. \nNow, our opponents claim to be the party of the middle class, but Democrats don't understand this fundamental point: It's really hard for people to be part of the middle class if they don't have a job.\nNow, I know a bit about these things.\nI grew up in a meatpacking town. For much of his life, my dad was a truck driver. My mom was a homemaker. She died when I was 16 years old, and my dad lost his job not long after that. I was the only one of five kids in our family who had a chance to go to college.\nWhen I traveled the country these past few years, I met Americans from all different walks of life. If you ask middle-class Americans about their hopes and their dreams, they'll share their heart but also their concerns. Can they pay the mortgage? Will they have enough money to buy groceries or put gas in the car? Will they be able to get their kids into college or pay the tuition?\nBut jobs don't come from politicians. They come from the entrepreneurs, the inventors, the innovators and the risk-takers. \nWe need to let them know that help's on the way. And help's name is Mitt Romney. \nLadies and gentlemen, we have the best candidate. This isn't his first job or the first time he's been a leader who's produced results. He's made a success of failing companies. He made a success of the Olympics. He even made government in Massachusetts more effective and efficient. And now he's ready to help get America back on track and Americans back to work. He has a plan to strengthen and grow America's middle class with lower taxes, a government that works for the American people instead of dashing their hopes and dreams, lowering energy prices and greater access to quality education for all.\nBut there's one other thing that I want to leave you with tonight. It's important for America to know that Mitt Romney is not only a great leader; he's also a remarkable person. \nAs a former governor, I know that leadership takes optimism, but not blind optimism. We need a leader who understands the depth of our challenges but who also doesn't shy away from them.\nMitt Romney knows what our problems are, and he has the tools and the experience and the energy and the right policies to fix them. \nAfter four years of this president, we need Mitt Romney now more than ever. \nI'm proud to be supporting him for president of the United States, and I know you are too. And with any luck, in a few months, Barack Obama will at last get some experience in the private sector. \nThank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. Good night. ", "Thank you. Thank you very much. Buenas noches, Puerto Rico. Buenas noches, Florida. Buenas noches, America.\nAs a proud American serving the nearly 4 million American citizens of Puerto Rico, I'm honored to be with you tonight. We gather to celebrate the hopes and dreams of every American. We all believe in the greatness of this nation. And this greatness lies within each of us.\nHardworking Americans are fighting every day to provide for themselves and their families and leave a more prosperous country for the next generation. That is true here in Florida, it is true in Puerto Rico, and it is true throughout this great land of ours.\nBut as families have tightened their budgets, Washington continues its wasteful spending.\nUnless we elect leaders who take responsibility now, our children and theirs will pay for it later. \nYou and I know there is a better way, and like many conservative governors around the country, we are proving it. When I took office, I inherited a $3.3 billion budget deficit, per person the largest anywhere in this nation. We could not even meet our payroll. We were on the brink of bankruptcy.\nBut we did not shy away from our responsibility to lead. We cut government expenses by almost 20 percent, starting with my own salary. We reduced our deficit 90 percent while continuing to invest in our schools, hospitals and highways. At the same time, we slashed taxes 50 percent on individuals and 30 percent on businesses, the largest tax cut in Puerto Rico history. \nAnd guess what? Our private sector, the real economy, began to create jobs again. Imagine if we had national policies that support rather than prevent growth. We'd then be able to truly unleash the engine of prosperity that our country and our people deserve. That's what Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will do for America. They understand that each community's challenges are unique, but the answers are the same.\nOur families cannot grow their budgets if politicians keep growing Washington's budget. We need to get government out of our way. And we need to let freedom and the spirit of the American people shine through. We can outthink, out-dream, out-work and outproduce anybody in the world.I know it, you know it, and Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan certainly know it. \nI like to talk a lot about freedom because freedom is the essence of who we are as Americans. Over 200,000 Puerto Ricans have served in uniform \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0to defend our nation and the freedom we hold so dear. Like in your home states, we raise and salute the American flag. Just like our fellow citizens in Florida or Virginia, we share the same undying spirit that all Americans have.\nAllow me to share an example of that spirit. I visited a soldier from Puerto Rico at Walter Reed Army Medical Center several years ago. This young man had bravely served in combat and was given little chance to live. Without knowing if he could hear me, in every visit I would whisper into his ear. I would tell him how proud and thankful we were for his dedication and sacrifice, adding, \"No te rindas,\" \"Don't give up.\" \nMonths later, after his miraculous recovery, I had the honor of awarding the Purple Heart. He never gave up. \nFor him and for every American in uniform, we will never give up.For every mother who struggles, saves and sacrifices so her children will have greater opportunities, we will never give up.For every small-business owner who builds it to make a better life, we will never give up.For Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, who know what it takes to put America back to work and back on track, we will never give up.And for the values \u2014\u00a0the values that make America great, the justice that is our right, the freedom to unleash the greatness within each of us and the liberty that God endowed every American \u2014\u00a0for that, I will never give up.\nYou will never give up. We will never give up.God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. ", "Good evening. My name is Steven Cohen, and I am president of Screen Machine Industries, a family-owned manufacturer of construction and mining equipment located in the great Buckeye State of Ohio. Our country's nearly 30 million small businesses serve as the American backbone for job creation and product innovation. The opportunity to create new products and open new markets is the American dream. This capitalistic spirit has supported our economy since its founding.\nAs a manufacturer, our products are the heartbeats of our business. We can't tolerate other companies stealing hard work without compensation. It can take several years and tens of thousands of dollars to achieve patent status. Once granted, we expect it to be protected.\nOur products are often stolen and copied overseas for a mere fraction of the price. All too often tariffs and unfair trade practices make it difficult for American businesses to export. We need a president that will protect America's patented inventions, guard the value of our currency and open up new markets for American products. \nAmerican small businesses face a mountain of regulations and taxes. In addition, our international competitors do not have to face the upcoming costs associated with funding a multi-billion-dollar health care plan, overreaching emissions standards and the unnecessary war on coal. These factors create a tremendous disadvantage in the global marketplace. We need an administration that will lessen tax burdens and government regulations that strangle small businesses.\nWhile we face higher government-imposed costs, cheaper imports from overseas companies flood our markets. Unnecessary regulations and mandates imposed on business make our products more expensive to make and less competitive to sell. We need a Romney administration to ensure our country's competitiveness and give our companies the opportunities to expand and hire again. Let's bring back that original American will to invent, employ and prosper! Thank you.", "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Yohana de la Torre live from backstage in the Republican National Convention. And today I have the honor to be with Michigan delegate Michelle Voorheis. Welcome, Michelle. Hi, Yohana. It's great to be here tonight.Michelle, why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself?Well, I'm a wife and a mom, and I come from the small town of Clio, Michigan. And I'm a small- business owner.I understand that you have a commercial real estate business. How has your business fared under President Obama?'Well, first let me say that Obama did not build my business. But he is doing everything in his power to tear it down. Under his administration, the regulations and restrictions that he is placing on the banks have caused them to stop lending money. So even though my husband and I have excellent credit and we've never missed a payment, we're unsure whether we're going to be able to get the financing to continue funding our business.\nThis creates uncertainty for us, so we aren't hiring any employees. This makes for 12- to 14-hour days that we have to work to keep our business running. I have an 18-year-old son that I just sent off to college and a 90-year-old mother-in-law that we are caring for, and I don't see any end in sight if something doesn't change soon.What does your future look like for you?Well, first I want to say that we give thanks to God for everything that we have. My husband and I have been married for 35 years, and during that time, we have worked hard, we've played by the rules, we've done everything right. So we thought at the end of the day we were going to have a great retirement and we were going to have a successful business that we could leave to our kids. But right now, I don't know if I'm ever going to get to retire. I'm 55. I don't want to start over again and do something else. So under the Obama administration, I feel that our dreams are slipping away.Michelle's story is just one of the many of small- business owners and what they're going through today during the President Obama's administration.\nNow we go back live to the Republican National Convention. I'm Yohana de la Torre. Thank you. ", "Thank you. Thank you. \nAnd hello to the fired-up delegation from the Buckeye State right there in front of me. \nMy name is Rob Portman, and they say I was on Governor Romney's short list of vice presidential candidates. Apparently, it wasn't short enough. What a great convention. And I'm delighted to be here tonight to talk about the fundamental differences between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama when it comes to understanding our economy.\nLet's begin by talking about something the Democrats love to demonize: Mitt Romney's success in the private sector. He built a company from the ground up, created lots of jobs, and yes, he made money. \nThen you have Barack Obama, who never started a business, never even worked in business, and yet he claims those who have should give credit to the government or someone else for their success. \nSo you have one candidate who understands that success comes from working hard, competing and taking risks. And you have another candidate who believes that success comes from government. Right answer. Let me ask you this: Which one would you choose to invest your life savings?Should it be any different for safeguarding our nation's economy?Or let's say you don't have any savings. Let's say you're worried about how to pay September's rent or mortgage. Let's say you're one of the millions of Americans out of work or millions more who have given up looking for work. You've got to be running out of patience and hope. You've got to be tired, looking for a new start. Well, you don't have to be patient any longer. Through your vote this fall, you can change the leadership of this country and the opportunities for you and your families. \nAmerica, it's been nearly four years of 8 percent unemployment \u2014\u00a0double-digit unemployment for young people, Hispanics, African Americans. Four years. FDR and Truman won an entire world war in four years. America is tired of waiting. \nPresident Obama says that he deserves re-election because his economic policies have worked. Not in this universe, they haven't. In fact, the experts tell us that if we don't change our policies, we're going back into recession next year. Folks, tens of millions of Americans are not out of the last recession. Governor Romney had a plan to build his business.\nHe now has a detailed plan to restore our economy and strengthen the middle class. I ask you, where's the president's economic plan? Blaming others does not qualify as a plan.\nNow, the president did submit a budget. It was so bad, folks, that not a \u2014\u00a0\nPresident Obama has been right about at least one prediction he's made about the economy. He said: If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition. \nI think you're right about that, Mr. President. It hasn't worked because you cannot spend your way, regulate your way, tax your way or blame your way out of the economic mess that we're in. \nIn contrast, President Obama is the first president in 75 years \u2014\u00a0Democrat or Republican \u2014\u00a0who hasn't even sought the ability to negotiate export agreements and open markets overseas.\nNow why is this important? Because 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside of our borders, and to create jobs, our workers and our farmers need to sell more of what we make to those people. \nWhile this administration has been dragging its feet, other countries have been busy negotiating hundreds of new trade agreements to benefit their workers, their farmers, taking away our opportunities. President Obama has been so driven to advance his big- government ideology that he has abandoned the daily work that a government must do to open markets, restore business confidence and create the climate for job growth. This is the work President Romney would begin on day one. Take trade with China. China manipulates its currency, giving it an unfair trade advantage. So why doesn't the president do something about it? I'll tell you one reason. President Obama could not run up his record trillion-dollar deficit if the Chinese didn't buy our bonds to finance them. Folks, we are as beholden to China for bonds as we are to the Middle East for oil. This will end under Mitt Romney. \nWe need to knock down these barriers to trade abroad, but we also need to knock down self-imposed barriers to success right here at home. We need to reform our outdated and complicated tax code. We need to fix our burdensome regulatory system. And we need an energy policy that encourages the development of our resources right here, in the ground, in America.\nAmerica has a choice between Mitt Romney, who seeks to grow the economy, and Barack Obama, who seeks to redistribute it. Which one do you think will liberate America's entrepreneurial spirit?At the other party's convention, you're going to hear another chant. Their chant will be, \"Four more years, four more years.\" Folks, we cannot afford four more years. Governor Romney \u2014\u00a0Governor Romney chose a terrific partner in Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. Paul's a close friend, a great family man, and he's got a reformer's heart.\nContrast this to Joe Biden. Vice President Biden has told people out of work to, quote, just hang in there. So much for hope and change. Paul Ryan is not asking America to continue to hang in there. He's proposing new policies that will give poor and middle-class families opportunities and hope for the future. Mitt Romney made his mark turning around businesses, solving problems. Paul Ryan made his mark as a respected reformer focused on results.\nTogether, they will do what President Obama has not done: They will lead in breaking through the partisan gridlock in Washington, D.C. America, give them the chance to restore America's economy and restore the American dream.\nI've seen that dream up close. When I was a kid, my dad left his job as a salesman for a big company and started his own business, taking a risk. He sold forklift trucks. My mom was the bookkeeper. She had to borrow money \u2014\u00a0they had to borrow money from her uncle because the bank wouldn't give him a loan. He lost money the first few years, but he never lost his dream. By the time he retired and my brother took over, the business had 200 employees. Two hundred families in southwest Ohio were supported by that business.\nThis is the classic American story not of government telling us what to do but of free men and free women willing to work hard and take a risk to build something of value for themselves, their families and their community. About a year into the Obama administration, I asked my dad whether he would do it again. He said, Rob, with all the uncertainty out there today, I don't know if I would take the risk. In that one sentence, folks, he summed up what I've heard from hundreds of small-business owners all across Ohio and around this great country. They're afraid to make the investment, and jobs are the casualty. \nLadies and gentlemen, we need new leadership and new policies to bring back the dream and renew America's promise. \nNo more excuses, no more blaming others, no more waiting. We need Romney-Ryan, and we need them now. \nThank you, and God bless our great country. ", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, energy powers everything we do, and America depends on reliable and affordable energy. This is a simple concept, but the Obama administration does not get it. His policies are driving us away from energy independence, not towards it.\nMitt Romney knows that we need an all-of-the-above energy policy that includes oil, gas and coal and renewables like wind and solar so that we can finally secure energy independence for our country. Infrastructure is fundamental to all energy systems, and infrastructure is critical to achieving energy independence, infrastructure like pipelines, which prompts me to ask, Mr. President, where is the Keystone pipeline? \nI am part of the third generation of a family-owned businesses, and we operate pipelines in the great states of Wyoming, North Dakota and Montana.\nThese companies were started by my grandfather and then run by my father and uncles. Between them and our 152 dedicated and incredibly talented employees, we built almost 4,000 miles of pipeline. A lot of our recent work has been constructing new pipeline infrastructure in western North Dakota to support the development of the Bakken oil shale, an exciting and an important development for America.\nSome time ago we agreed to build the on ramp the Keystone XL pipeline, so that it could take American-produced oil to American markets. If Keystone had received timely approval of their permit, it would be under construction today. Instead Americans have missed out on jobs from this pipeline because the Obama administration has played politics with the Keystone project.\nMy hope is that my three boys, Henry, Sam and Charlie, will be part of the fourth generation of our family business. \nLadies and gentlemen, this is not about just one pipeline. This is about a fundamental transformation of America's energy system so that we can achieve that long sought-after goal of energy independence. \nMore importantly, it's about my three boys and your children and about rebuilding a nation that can once again power itself.\nThank you.", "Good evening, conventiongoers. I'm Tara Wald live for the 2012 Republican National Convention here on the convention floor, and with me is Yash Wadhwa, your civil engineer from India. Tell us a little bit about why you came and you immigrated to this country. Give us a little snapshot.Let me first say one thing: I'm a proud Republican from the state of Wisconsin! All right, good old Paul Ryan country.The next vice president of the United States. I came to this country as a student with few dollars in my pocket and a dream in my heart. I knew America was a country which provided opportunities for any person from anywhere in the world and live the American dream. Guess what, I have lived the American dream. All right.And I'm very proud of it. This is the best country on earth, and I love it with passion. In 1980 something happened which changed my life: A man by the name of Ronald Reagan was elected the president of the United States. And he inspired me so much that I decided to become a U.S. citizen and a Republican.\nAll right. Well, tell me this. You owned a small business for 22 years. So in your opinion, what are the biggest challenges that small-business owners face today?Well, let me go back to Ronald Reagan a little bit. Ronald Reagan used to say that America is a shining city on a hill. Under President Obama, we are becoming a tent city with people waiting in line for government handouts, and I don't like it.All right. Back to the program.", "As attorneys general, we have been on the front line defending the Constitution and the American people from a president driven to exercise government power over our freedoms, our rights and our lives. We know that the Constitution limits federal power, but President Obama clearly believes those limits just get in his way. So he ignores them time and again.\nHe promises to rescue our economy and environment by investing in green jobs but instead funnels your tax dollars into campaign donors' pockets. He promised to have the most transparent administration in history but now refuses to come clean with Congress and the American people about Fast and Furious.He sure does. He talks about giving us more control over health care decisions but instead grants that power to government bureaucrats. He claims that government is responsible for private-sector success, but the only thing he is building is bigger government. And \"Obamacare\" is exhibit A. It distorts our Constitution and endangers our fragile economy. We did everything in our power to stop it, taking the fight all the way to the United States Supreme Court. We prevailed on our two main arguments.The court agreed that the Commerce Clause of the Constitution does not allow the federal government to purchase a product \u2014\u00a0to force you to purchase something that you do not want.\nThe court agreed that the Constitution does not allow the federal government to force states to adopt a budget-busting expansion of Medicaid.Then came the shocker: The Supreme Court upheld the individual insurance mandate by calling it something the president swore it never was: a tax. At every stage of the process, President Obama and congressional Democrats promised us that the mandate was not a tax because they knew Americans were hurting, and the last thing we needed was another tax, because they knew if the American public were told that \"Obamacare\" was just a massive tax hike, they wouldn't have a prayer of passing it.Right. Instead, President Obama and the Democrats called it a mandate. Then they turned around and, without a shred of shame, asked the court to call the mandate a tax. Yet the president can't bring himself to acknowledge publicly that the only reason this unaffordable care act still stands is because it is a tax.\nThis is what happens when a president has such total disregard for our individual liberty that he knowingly and purposely imposes unwarranted restrictions against the will of the people. This is not why our Founding Fathers risked their lives and their fortunes when they created a nation. This is not why young American men and women today risk their lives in defense of freedom.\nSo tonight we ask you: Do you want skyrocketing health insurance premiums?Do you want enormous new financial burdens on young people, who already shoulder our nation's crushing debt?Do you want the government to force individuals and religious institutions to violate the tenets of their faith?Do you want over $1 trillion in new tax increases?Do you want a job-destroying insurance mandate that strangles our businesses?Do you \u2014\u00a0do you want a federal government that tells you what to do, what to think or what to buy when it comes to your health care?Do you want the federal government to steal hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare to hide the true cost of \"Obamacare\"?Do you want more of this for four more years?The health care lawsuit has reminded all of us that the Constitution limits the power of government. It has reminded us of the precious relationship between federalism and individual liberty. And though we fundamentally disagree with his decision, Chief Justice Roberts did observe that it is not the Supreme Court's job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.That's right. It is our job to make a new choice. It is time to stand up and say, in a loud, clear voice, enough!It is time to repeal \"Obamacare.\" It is time to stop those who ignore the Constitution when it's expedient.\nIt is time to remember that our rights are not a gift from government, but from God, and that by his grace, we will defend them. It is time for Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.\nThank you.Thank you.Have a great night. Thank you.", "Thank you. Thank you, South Dakota, and good evening, my fellow Republicans.\nIt's no secret that I'm a sports fan. In fact, I get asked all the time if I've ever played basketball with President Obama. The answer is no. I'm still waiting for that invitation.\nThe next question is, do you think you could take him one-on-one. And I say: I really don't know. I've never seen him play. But I can tell you this: President Obama would be easy to defend because you know he's always going to go to his left. \nLike many Americans, I've been blessed by the hard work and sacrifice of those who've come before. You see, it was back in 1906 that two Norwegian brothers named Nicolai and Matthew Gjeslvik came to this country in search of the American dream.\nWhen they reached the shores of America, the only English words they knew were the words \"apple pie\" and \"coffee,\" which, evidently, they had plenty of on the way over.\nThe immigration officials at Ellis Island determined that their name, Gjelsvik, which was spelled G-J-E-L-S-V-I-K, was too difficult to spell and pronounce, so they asked them to change it. The two brothers picked the name of the farm where they worked in Norway, which was called the Thune Farm. And so Nicolai Gjelsvik became Nick Thune, my grandfather.\nWith their new country \u2014\u00a0\nMy grandfather raised three sons. The middle son, my father, joined the Navy when World War II broke out. He became a naval aviator, flying combat missions off the aircraft carrier Intrepid in the Pacific theater. On one mission, he shot down four enemy aircraft, for which he received the Distinguished Flying Cross. After the war, my dad quietly returned to South Dakota, to his hardware store and his family.\nYou know, many versions of that story are told all across this country. The details may be different, but the dream is the same. \nI hate to say it, but that dream is in serious jeopardy.\nWe have a sluggish economy burdened by Obama administration policies that are weighing down our job creators. Middle-class Americans in cities and on our farms are bearing the brunt. The big-government bureaucrats of the Obama administration have set their sights on our way of life. Instead of preserving family farms and ranches, President Obama's policies are effectively regulating them out of business. His administration even proposed banning farm kids from doing basic chores. \nSince President Obama took office, we've had 42 consecutive months of unemployment above 8 percent, the longest streak on record. The cost of family health insurance premiums has risen by nearly 19 percent. College tuition has increased by 25 percent. And fuel costs have doubled. The number of people on food stamps has increased by 45 percent. And the debt that we are piling on the backs of our children and grandchildren has gone up by 50 percent. Yet for all of President Obama's talk about the middle class, middle-class incomes are down.\nFolks, we won't be in this situation with Mitt Romney in the White House. He understands \u2014\u00a0It comes from recognizing the strengths and contributions of every individual.\nHis experience tells him that the most valuable insight can be gained not by lecturing, but by listening.\nAnd when he does use his presidential bully pulpit, it will be to champion the cause of small business and make it clear to all companies that it is safe to hire again. \nOn day one of Mitt Romney's presidency, the transformation of Washington will begin. Gone will be the arrogance of a president whose first instinct is to condemn achievement. Gone will be the attitude that government knows best and solves all. What you will see and hear is a president who will do everything in his power to make sure government is a catalyst for growth, not an obstacle to success. And you will have a president with a plan to strengthen the middle class.\nMy friends, may it never be said of us that when confronted with the economic peril before us, that we averted our eyes, turned away and did nothing. Our children's future depends on our willingness to act and our decision to elect Mitt Romney president of the United States. ", "Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. \nYou know, I had \u2014\u00a0I had hopes once of addressing you under different circumstances. \nWhen we nominate Mitt Romney, we do so with a greater purpose than winning an advantage for our party. We charge him with the care of a higher cause. His election represents the best hopes for our country and the world. It is said that this election will turn on domestic and economic issues. But what Mitt Romney knows and what we know is that the success at home also depends on our leadership in the world. It is our willingness to shape world events for the better that has kept us safe, increased our prosperity, preserved our liberty and transformed human history.\nAt our best, America has led. We have led by our example as a shining city on a hill. We have led at the direction of patriots from both parties. We have led shoulder to shoulder with steadfast friends and allies. We have led by giving voice to the voiceless, insisting that every human life has dignity and aiding those brave souls who risked everything to secure the inalienable rights that are endowed to all by our Creator. We have \u2014\u00a0\nThis is what makes America an exceptional nation. It's not just a matter of who we are; it's the record of what we have done. It is the responsibility that generation after generations of Americans has affirmed and carried forward. It is a cause that many Americans have sacrificed everything, absolutely everything to defend. And when they've gone into battle, as they do today, they have done so with a conviction that the country that sent them there is worth their sacrifice, that it stands for something more than the sum of our individual interests.\nMay God bless all who have served, all who serve today, as he has blessed us with their service. \nWe are now being tested by an array of threats that are more complex more numerous and just as deeply and deadly as I can recall in my lifetime. We face a consequential choice, and make no mistake, it is a choice. We can choose to follow a declining path toward a future that is dimmer and more dangerous that our past, or we can choose to reform our failing government, revitalize our ailing economy and renew the foundations of our power and leadership in the world. That is what's at stake in this election. \nUnfortunately, for four years, for four years, we've drifted away from our proudest traditions of global leadership, traditions that are truly bipartisan. We've let the challenges we face both at home and abroad become much harder to solve. We can't afford to stay on that course any longer. We can't afford to cause our friends and allies, from Latin America, to Europe, to Asia, to the Middle East and especially in Israel, a nation under existential threat, to doubt America's leadership. We can't afford to give governments in Russia and China a veto over how we defend our interests and the progress of our values in the world.\n\nI believe we can't afford to substitute a political timetable for a military strategy. By committing to withdraw from Afghanistan before peace can be achieved and sustained, the president has discouraged our friends and emboldened our enemies, which is why our commanders did not recommend these decisions and why they have said it puts our mission at much greater risk. We can't afford another $500 billion in cuts in our defense budget on top of the nearly 500 billion \nHis own secretary of defense has said that cutting our military by nearly a trillion dollars would be devastating, and yet the president is playing no leadership role in preventing this crippling blow to our military.\nA wise congressman from Wisconsin has said: Our fiscal policy and our foreign policy are on a collision course. And that man is our next vice president, Paul Ryan. \nBut most of all, we can't afford to abandon the cause of human freedom. When long-suffering peoples demand liberation from their jailers and torturers and tyrants, the leader of the free world must stand with them.\nUnfortunately, this is not happening. When Iranians rose up by the millions against their oppressive rulers; when they beseeched our president, chanting in English, are you with us or are you with them; when the entire world watched as a brave young woman named Neda was shot and bled to death in a street in Tehran, the president missed an historic opportunity to throw America's full moral support behind an Iranian revolution that shared one of our highest interests, ridding Iran of a brutal dictatorship that terrorized the Middle East and threatens the world. \nThe situation is far worse in Syria. What began as peaceful protests has now become, 18 months later, a savage and unfair fight. With the full backing of Iran and Hezbollah and Russia, with tanks and helicopters and fighter jets, Bashar Assad is murdering men, women and children. More than 20,000 people have perished. Extremists are gaining ground, and the conflict is becoming more dangerous by the day for our allies and for us.\nIn other times, when other courageous people fought for their freedom against sworn enemies of the United States, American presidents, both Republicans and Democrats, have acted to help them prevail.\n\nSadly for the lonely voices of dissent in Syria and Iran and elsewhere in the world who feel forgotten in their darkness and sadly for us as well, our president is not being true to our values. My friends, across the world, people are seizing control of their own destinies. They are liberating themselves from oppressive rulers. And they want America's support. They want America's assistance as they struggle to live in peace and security, to expand opportunity for themselves and their children, to replace the injustices of despots with the institutions of democracy and freedom. America must be on the right side of history. \nThe demand for our leadership in the world has never been greater. People don't want less of America; they want more.\nEverywhere I go in the world, people tell me that they still have faith in America. What they want to know is whether we still have faith in ourselves.\nI trust that Mitt Romney has that faith, and I trust him to lead us. I trust him to affirm our nation's exceptional character and responsibilities. I trust him to know that our security and economic interests are inextricably tied to the progress of our values. I trust him to know that if America doesn't lead, our adversaries will. And the world will go darker, poorer and much more dangerous.\nI trust him to know that an American president always, always, always stands up for the rights and freedoms and justice of all people. \nAnd now, my fellow Americans, let's elect our next commander in chief and the next leader of the free world, my friend Governor Mitt Romney. ", "Thank you very much. Good evening. I am proud to be one of the 212,000 service women who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past decade.Thank you.\nAs a 24-year-old Virginian in Iraq, I worked with some of the most courageous men and women this nation has to offer. And we were united in a singular cause: to protect the nation that we love. \nIt has been my privilege to serve alongside heroes of every service. Defending this nation and its citizens is not without sacrifice for service members and the families that support them. And that is why that we need leaders who don't play chicken with our nation's defense. And that is why we need Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.\nNow, it is my distinct honor to introduce Chris Devon Young, a hero in his own right, a former Coast Guardsmen and a two-time Paralympic Gold Medalist in alpine skiing.\nChris. Thank you. It is wonderful to be here with you tonight.\nIn 1982, while flying in heavy fog during a Coast Guard mission, our plane crashed, leaving me paralyzed from the waist down.\nWhile my career as a Coast Guardsman ended, a new world of service began for me. Twenty-seven years ago, this California boy was introduced to ski racing at the first Veterans Administration winter sports clinic. I decided then and there to dedicate to my life to racing and coaching other injured veterans.\nBeing a gold medal paralympian gives me a whole new way to honor and serve my country. Being the coach \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0being the coach of paralympic medalists gives me a way to honor and serve others.\nAnd I believe that we can all serve, no matter what our challenges, because it's not about what you've lost in life, but rather what you are able to give. \nNow it is my honor to introduce a hero who's given of himself regardless of the price. He is the son and grandson of admirals. He's a decorated naval pilot, a war hero and THE senior senator of the great state of Arizona, Senator John McCain. ", "\nI remember the first time I went to the Oval Office as president. I was in awe. And after I got there, I had a guest, and that was president 41.I was in the bathtub at the White House residence, and Ramsey , a guy that worked there, came in and said, yeah, that bathtub \u2014\u00a0your son is over in the Oval Office.As I recall, the conversation went something like this: Welcome, Mr. President. It's good to see you, Mr. President. And that's all we said.It was fun just walking in and seeing your own son be the president of the United States.And I remember visiting Dad in the Oval Office when he was president and how much reverence he treated the office. And I tried to do the same thing. I mean, the Oval Office is a place where you make decisions and welcome dignitaries and welcome some friends. But it's a place that always has to be treated with respect and dignity.Lech Walesa's visit to the White House \u2014\u00a0we'd sort of been involved with him in Poland and gotten to know him. And he came to the White House, and he really spoke no English. But he mentioned freedom and stooped down as he was getting the award the president can give a foreigner and kissed the ground. And I must say I was very emotional.The first time Vladimir Putin came to visit Washington \u2014\u00a0and the sun was pouring through the windows, and I mean, the Oval Office just sparkled. And the door opened up, and in came President Putin. And his first words were, my God.\nWhen Dad was president he kindly would invite all of us up to the White House. He actually invited me to the state dinner with the queen. He took a huge risk, a diplomatic gamble \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but it worked out OK.What'd she say? It's a \u2014\u00a0--Yeah, something about black sheep. \u2014\u00a0and we moved him as far away as possible for the luncheon.Not going to do it. Wouldn't be prudent. \u2014\u00a0we were coming into the speech room, said, ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States, and in walked Dana Carvey.First thing I notice, this podium is for the other guy over there. So we didn't really have any issues with family, but our dog did bite a reporter. \nWell, I hope people will remember George, and I think they will, for having the determination and the toughness and the persistence to be able to see us through in our country through such a very difficult time after the terrorist attack. I'm so proud of George.Integrity, honesty, there was never a taint of scandal around his presidency. And I think \u2014\u00a0I think we forget the importance of that. But they'll remember him for being a good, honest president who maybe got a lot of things done, but I think \u2014\u00a0I think the thing I take pride in is integrity.History will remember him as a great president. Not only was he well-prepared for the job, but when the unexpected took place, he handled it with vision, a clear strategy and calm nerves.He is the most decent, honorable, wonderful \u2014\u00a0nobody's ever been as lucky as I've been.\nI want people to remember him as courageous. I want them to remember him as he is.Dad and I both know what it takes to be president. And there's no doubt in our minds that Mitt Romney will be a great president.He's a good man.And I hope that all the people at the convention work really, really hard because I think the Romneys are prepared. I think Ann Romney will be great. And I think Mitt Romney will do a fabulous job.This gives me a chance to \u2014\u00a0also to thank everybody gathered in Tampa and to send our very best wishes to everybody at the convention. We've been to lots of conventions in the past. We want to thank everyone there for their very, very strong support for all of our Republican candidates --Absolutely.\u2014\u00a0from your local ones to our candidate for president, Mitt Romney.\n\n", "Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\nYou know, when the Supreme Court upheld \"Obamacare,\" the first words out of my mouth were, I still think it's unconstitutional. \nSo I've had time to count to 10, and you know what?\nI still think it's unconstitutional. Do you think Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas have changed their mind?I think if James Madison himself, the father of the Constitution, were here today, he would agree with me. The whole damn thing is still unconstitutional. \nThis debate is not new, and it's not over. Hamilton and Madison fought from the beginning about how the government would be limited by the enumerated powers. Madison was unequivocal: the powers of the federal government are few and defined. The \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the power to tax and spend is restricted by the enumerated powers.\nSo how do we fix this travesty of justice? There's only one option left. We have to have a new president. \nAnyone who so fundamentally misunderstands American greatness is uniquely unqualified to lead this great nation. \nThe great and abiding lesson of American history, particularly the Cold War, is that the engine of capitalism, the individual, is mightier than any collective. American \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0American inventiveness and desire to build developed because we were guaranteed the right to own our success. For most of our history, no one dared tell Americans, you didn't build that.\nIn Bowling Green, Kentucky, the Tang \nWhen you say \u2014\u00a0when you say they didn't built it, you insult each and every American who ever got up at the crack of dawn. You insult any American who ever put on overalls or a suit. You insult any American who ever studied late into the night to become a doctor or a lawyer.\nYou insult the dishwasher, the cook, the waitress. You insult anyone who has ever dragged themselves out of bed to strive for something better for themselves and their children.\nMy great-grandfather, like many, came to this country in search of the American dream. No sooner had he stepped off the boat than his father died. He arrived in Pittsburgh as a teenager with nothing, not a penny. He found the American dream: not great wealth, but a bit of property in a new land that gave him hope for his children. In America, as opposed to the old country, success was based on merit. Probably America's greatest asset was that for the first time, success was not based on who you were but what you did. \nMy grandfather would live to see his children become doctors and ministers, accountants and professors. He would even live to see one of his sons, a certain congressman from Texas \u2014\u00a0\nImmigrants have flocked to our shores seeking freedom. Our forebears came full of hopes and dreams. So consistent and prevalent were these aspirations that they crystallized into a national yearning we call the American dream. No other country has a dream so inextricably associated with the spirit of its people.\nIn 1982 an American sailor, John Mooney , wrote a letter to his parents that captures the essence of the American dream. He wrote, dear Mom and Dad, today we spotted a boat in the water, and we rendered assistance. We picked up 65 Vietnamese refugees. As they approached the ship, they were all waving and trying as best they could to say, hello, American sailor. Hello, freedom man. It's hard to see a boat full of people like that and not get a lump somewhere between chin and belly button, and it really makes one proud and glad to be an American. It reminds us of all \u2014\u00a0what America has been, a place a man or a woman can come to for freedom.\nHung and Twan Tring spent a year on a South Pacific island, existing on a cup of rice and water, until he was allowed to come to America.\nNow both of these men and their family are proud Americans. Hung manages a large company. They are the American dream.\nSo, Mr. President, don't go telling the Tring When the president says, you didn't build that, he's flat-out wrong. Businessmen and -women did build that. Businessmen and -women did earn their success. Without the success of American business, we wouldn't have any roads, bridges or schools.\nMr. President, you say the rich must pay their fair share.\nBut when you seek to punish the rich, the jobs that are lost are those of the poor and the middle class. \nOur nation faces a crisis. America wavers. Unfortunately, we are one of a select group of countries whose debt now equals their gross domestic product. The republic of Washington and Jefferson is now in danger of becoming the democracy of debt and despair. Our great nation is coming apart at the seams, and the president just seems to point fingers and blame others.\nPresident Obama's administration will add nearly $6 trillion to our national debt in just one term. \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, though, must slay their sacred cows.\nRepublicans must acknowledge that not every dollar spent on the military is necessary or well-spent. \nRepublicans and Democrats must replace fear with confidence, confidence that no terrorist and no country will ever conquer us if we remain steadfast to the principles of our founding documents. \nAuthor Paul Kengor writes of a brisk evening in a small town in Illinois, returning home from a basketball game at the YMCA, an 11- year-old boy stunned by the sight of his father sprawled out in the snow on the front porch. He was drunk, his son would later remember, dead to the world, crucified. The dad's hair was soaked with melted snow matted against his reddened face. The boy stood over his father for a minute or two. He simply wanted to let himself in the door and pretend his dad wasn't there. Instead, he grabbed a fistful of overcoat and he heaved his dad into the bedroom, away from the weather's harm and the neighbors' attention. This young boy would become the man Ronald Reagan \u2014\u00a0\nThe American dream is that any among us could become the next Thomas Edison, the next Henry Ford, the next Ronald Reagan. But to lead us forward away from this looming debt crisis, it will take someone who believes in America's greatness, who believes in and can articulate the American dream, someone who has created jobs, someone who understands and appreciates what makes America great, someone who will lead our party and our nation forward.\nI believe that someone is our nominee, Governor Mitt Romney. \nAs Reagan said, our freedom is never more than a generation away from extinction. If our freedom is taken, the American dream will wither and die. To lead we must transform the coldness of austerity into the warm, vibrant embrace of prosperity. To overcome the current crisis, we must appreciate and applaud American success. We must step forward unabashedly and proclaim, you did build that. ", "Ladies and gentlemen, we're here this week for the simple reason that our nation is in desperate need of leadership, and we believe Mitt \u2014\u00a0we believe Mitt Romney is the man for this moment. \nAmerica is about to turn the page on Barack Obama's four-year experiment in big government. And it starts by renewing our belief that we are called to do something better. Over the past four years, Americans have been led to believe we're just like everybody else, that America really isn't unique.\nBut it's not true. We are \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0we are different \u2014\u00a0not because of where we were born, but because of who we are as a people, because of what we have in here.\nThe president scoffs at this idea. To him this kind of thinking is the problem, not the solution. That's why he's spent the last four years lowering Americans' expectations instead of raising them. That's why he's been missing in action on the greatest challenges of our day. What this administration has in mind for America isn't a renewal; it's a great leveling out.\nIt wants the kind of government-imposed equality that in a single generation transformed Western Europe from a place where for centuries \u2014\u00a0for centuries high achievement and discovery and innovation were celebrated and prized to a place where they have elections about whether people should have to work, where they make promises they can't keep and write checks they can't cash. But that's not who we are. It doesn't even occur to an American that someone else will solve their problems. Americans take pride in solving problems for themselves. And if we fail, we get back up and try again. It's what we do. It's who we are.\nNow, the president may want to give up on the problems we face and simply manage the decline.\nBut the American people don't, and that's why this election is so very important. It's a choice about who we are. Are we still a country that takes risks, that innovates, that believes anything is possible? Or are we a country that is resigned to whatever liberty the government decides to dish out? Now, I tell students all the time the only way to fail in America is to quit. And I truly believe that that's the case, and I know Mitt Romney does too. \nFor four years, for four long years, Barack Obama's been running from the nation's problems. He hasn't been working to earn re- election; he's been working to earn a spot on the PGA Tour. \nAs we meet here tonight, America is suffering through an economic calamity of truly historic dimensions.\nSome are calling it the slowest recovery in our nation's entire 236- year history. My friends, to call this a recovery is an insult to recoveries. \nNow, this is not the result of forces that are beyond our control. It is not the result of some sinister political plot, as some of the more paranoid inhabitants of the left-wing fever swamps would have you believe. It is the result of the policies that Barack Obama and his Democratic allies in Congress spent two full years carefully putting into place, and which they are determined to continue if they win again. These are policies that are meant to gently, gently lull us into a state of lower expectations and diminished dreams.\nWe've gotten a preview of this future over the past few years. We hear the stories every day now: the father who puts on a suit every morning and leaves the house so his daughter doesn't know he lost his job, the recent college grad facing up to the painful reality that the only door that's open to her, after four years of study and a pile of debt, is her parents' door. These are the faces of the Obama economy.\nAnd this is America's future if we don't do something to change the course this president seems perfectly content to leave us on. So think about it.\nOn the same day we learned that unemployment went up in 44 out of 50 states last month \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the president of the United States took the airwaves to tell the people of Albuquerque that he enjoys green chili but prefers red. We know what the president's got on his iPod, but we don't know what he plans to do about the looming tax hike that could trigger yet another serious recession that would result in even more Americans losing their jobs.\nSo ladies and gentlemen, America cannot afford another four years of this. ", "Whoa! Thank you, and thank you, Luce.\nI can't wait to see what we're going to all do together. This is going to be so exciting! \nJust so you all know, the hurricane has hit landfall, and I think we should all take this moment and recognize that fellow Americans are in its path, and just hope and pray that all are \u2014\u00a0remain safe and no life is lost and no property is lost.\nSo we should all be thankful for this great country and grateful for our first responders and all that keep us safe in this wonderful country. \nWell, I want to talk to you tonight not about politics and not about party. And while there are many important issues we'll hear discussed in this convention and throughout this campaign, tonight I want to talk to you from my heart about our hearts.I want to talk not about what divides us but what holds us together as an American family. I want to talk to you tonight about that one great thing that unites us, that one great thing that brings us our greatest joy when times our good and the deepest solace in our dark hours. Tonight I want to talk to you about love.\nI want to talk to you about the deep and abiding love I have for a man I met at a dance many years ago and the profound love I have and I know we share for this country. I want to talk to you about that love so deep only a mother can fathom it, the love we have for our children and our children's children.\nAnd I want us to think tonight about the love we share for those Americans, our brothers and our sisters, who are going through difficult times, whose days are never easy, nights are always long and whose work never seems done. They are here among us tonight in this hall. They are here in neighborhoods across Tampa and all across America.\nThe parents who lie awake at night side by side, wondering how they'll be able to pay the mortgage or make the rent.\nThe single dad who's working extra hours tonight so that his kids can buy some new clothes to go back to school, can take a school trip or play a sport, so his kids can feel, you know, just like other kids.\nAnd the working moms who love their jobs but would like to work just a little less to spend more time with the kids, but that's just out of the question with this economy.\nOr how about that couple who would like to have another child but wonder how they'll afford it?\nI have been all across this country \u2014\u00a0and I know a lot of you guys \u2014\u00a0--\u2014\u00a0and I have seen and heard stories of how hard it is to get ahead now. You know what? I've heard your voices. They've said to me: I'm running in place, and we just can't get ahead.\nSometimes I think that late at night, if we were all silent for just a few moments and listened carefully, we could hear a collective sigh from the moms and dads across America who made it through another day and know that they'll make it through another one tomorrow, but in that end of the day moment, they just aren't sure how.\nAnd if you listen carefully, you'll hear the women sighing a little bit more than the men. It's how it is, isn't it? It's the moms who have always had to work a little harder to make everything right. It's the moms of this nation \u2014\u00a0single, married, widowed \u2014\u00a0who really hold this country together.\nWe're the mothers, we're the wives, we're the grandmothers, we're the big sisters, we're the little sisters, and we are the daughters. You know it's true, don't you? \nI love you women! And I hear your voices.\nYou are the ones that have to do a little bit more, and you know what it's like to work a little harder during the day to earn the respect you deserve at work. And then you come home at night and help with the book report, just because it has to be done. You know what those late night phone calls with an elderly parent are like and the long weekend drives just to see how they're doing. You know the fastest route to the local emergency room and which doctors actually answer the phone calls when you call at night. By the way, I know all about that.\nYou know what it's like to sit in that graduation ceremony and wonder how it was that so many long days turned into years that went by so quickly.\nYou are the best of America. You \u2014\u00a0\nI'm not sure if men really understand this, but I don't think there's a woman in America who really expects her life to be easy. In our own ways, we all know better. You know what, and that's fine; we don't want easy. But the last few years have been harder than they needed to be. It's all the little things. The \u2014\u00a0the price at the pump you just can't believe. The grocery bills that just get bigger. All those things that used to be free, like school sports, are one more bill to pay. It's all the little things that pile up to become big things. And the big things \u2014\u00a0the good jobs, the chance at college, that home you want to buy \u2014\u00a0just get harder.\nEverything has become harder. We're too smart to know there aren't easy answers, but we're not dumb enough to accept that there aren't better answers. \nAnd that is where this boy I met at a high school dance comes in. His name is Mitt Romney, and you should really get to know him. I don't mind that. But more than anything, he made me laugh.\nSome of you might not know this, but I am the granddaughter of a Welsh coal miner. He was determined \u2014\u00a0he was determined that his kids get out of the mines. My dad got his first job when he was 6 years old in a little village in Wales called Nantyffyllon cleaning bottles at The Colliers Arms.\nWhen he was 15, Dad came to America. In our country, he saw hope and an opportunity to escape from poverty. He moved to a small town in the great state of Michigan. He \u2014\u00a0he raised a family, and he became mayor of our town.\nMy dad would often remind my brothers and me how fortunate we were to grow up in a place like America. He wanted us to have every opportunity that came with life in this country, and so he pushed us to be our best and give our all.\nInside the houses that lined the streets of our town, there were a lot of good fathers teaching their sons and daughters those same values. I didn't know it at the time, but one of those dads was my future father-in-law, George Romney. Mitt's dad never graduated from college. Instead, he became a carpenter. He worked hard, he became the head of a car company and then the governor of Michigan.\nWhen Mitt and I met and fell in love, we were determined not to let anything stand in the way of our life together. I was an Episcopalian, he was a Mormon. We were very young, both still in college. There were many reasons to delay marriage. And you know what? We just didn't care. \nWe walked to class together, shared the housekeeping, ate a lot of pasta and tuna fish. Our desk was a door propped up on sawhorses. Our dining room table was a fold-down ironing board in the kitchen. But those were the best days.\nThen our first son came along. All at once, I'm 22 years old with a baby and a husband who's going to business school and law school at the same time. And I can tell you, probably like every other girl who finds herself in a new life, far from family and friends, with a new baby and a new husband, that it dawned on me that I had absolutely no idea what I was getting into. \nWell, that was 42 years ago. I've survived. We now have five sons and 18 beautiful grandchildren. \nI'm still in love with that boy I met at a high school dance, and he still makes me laugh. \nI read somewhere that Mitt and I have a storybook marriage. Well, let me tell you something: In the storybooks I read, there never were long, long rainy winter afternoons in a house with five boys screaming at once \u2014\u00a0\nI know this good and decent man for what he is. He's warm and loving and patient. He has tried to live his life with a set of values centered on family, faith and love of one's fellow man. From the time we were first married, I've seen him spend countless hours helping others. I've seen him drop everything to help a friend in trouble, and been there when late-night calls of panic come from a member of our church whose child has been taken to the hospital.\nYou may not agree with Mitt's positions on issues or his politics \u2014\u00a0by the way, Massachusetts is only 13 percent Republican, so it's not like it is a shock to me \u2014\u00a0\nIt's true that \u2014\u00a0it's true that Mitt's been successful at each new challenge he's taken on. You know what? It actually amazes me to see his history of success being attacked. Are those really the values that made our country great?As a mom of five boys, do we want to raise our children to be afraid of success?Do we send our children out in the world with the advice, try to do OK?And let's be honest. If the last four years had been more successful, do we really think there would be this attack on Mitt Romney's success?Of course not.\nMitt will be the first to tell you that he is the most fortunate man in the world. He had two loving parents who gave him strong values and taught him the value of work. He had the chance to get the education his father never had.\nBut as his partner on this amazing journey, I can tell you Mitt Romney was not handed success. He built it. He stayed in Massachusetts after graduate school and got a job.\nI saw the long hours that started with that first job. I was there when he had a small group of friends talking about starting a new company. I was there when they struggled and wondered if the whole idea just wasn't going to work. Mitt's reaction was to work harder and press on.\nToday that company has become another great American success story. Has it made those who started the company successful \u2014\u00a0made them successful beyond their dreams? Yes, it has. It allowed us to give our sons the chance at good educations and made all those long hours of book reports and homework worth every minute. It's given us the deep satisfaction of being able to help others in ways that we could never have imagined. This is important. I want you to hear what I'm going to say.\nMitt doesn't like to talk about how he has helped others because he sees it as a privilege, not a political talking point. \nBut because this is America, that small company which grew has helped so many others lead better lives. The jobs that grew from the risk they took have become college educations and first homes. That success has helped fund scholarships, pensions and retirement funds. This is the genius of America. Dreams fulfilled? Help others launch new dreams. \nAt every turn in his life, this man I met in a \u2014\u00a0at a high school dance has helped lift up others. He did it with the Olympics when many wanted to give up. He did it in Massachusetts, where he guided a state from economic crisis to unemployment of just 4.7 percent. Under Mitt, Massachusetts's schools were the best in the nation, the best. \nThis is the man America needs. \nThis man will not let us down. This man will lift up America.\nIt has been 47 years since that tall, kind of charming young man brought me home from our first dance. Not every day since has been easy. But he still makes me laugh, and never once did I have a single reason to doubt that I was the luckiest woman in the world tonight. \nI said tonight I wanted to talk to you about love. Look into your hearts. This is our country. This is our future. These are our children and grandchildren.\nYou can trust Mitt. He loves America. He will take us to a better place, just as he took me home safely from that dance. Give him that chance. Give America that chance.\nGod bless each and every one of you, and God Bless the United States of America. ", "Good evening, Tampa. My name is Luce, and it is great to be here with you tonight.\nI am the proud mother of 20-year-old triplets, I'm a practicing attorney, a very proud Latina and a die-hard Republican. \nAs a governor, he has unleashed a true Republican revolution that has already accomplished so much.\nIt is a success story of fiscal responsibility, controlled government spending, lower taxes and pro-growth policy.\nBut it is also one of caring and compassionate attention to a social and faith-based agenda of unprecedented reach and consequence. Through it all, I have stood by his side and learned what it takes to be the rock of support to a great leader, just like our next speaker has done for 43 years for our next president, Mitt Romney. \nAnn's story is one of remarkable courage, tenacity, perseverance and commitment, a story that stands in its own right, one that inspires all who know her, a woman of faith, a devoted wife, a caring mother to five boys, a multiple sclerosis and cancer survivor, a tireless advocate and a timeless first lady of Massachusetts. \nFor decades, she's been a fighter who has championed the cause of disadvantaged children, been an advocate of teenage pregnancy prevention, a leader of faith- and community-based initiatives and an ambassador for multiple sclerosis awareness. Watching her during a recent visit to Puerto Rico, I marveled at her ability to \u2014\u00a0\nNo wonder she's been Mitt Romney's secret weapon for 43 years. No wonder Mitt calls her his personal hero. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you my friend and the next first lady of the United States: Ann Romney. ", "I love South Carolina. \nI am the proud daughter of Indian immigrants who reminded my brothers, my sister and me every single day how blessed we were to live in this country. They loved the fact that only in America we could be as successful as we wanted to be and nothing would stand in our way.\nMy parents started a business out of the living room of our home, and 30-plus years later it was a multimillion-dollar company. But there wasn't a single day that it was easy, and there wasn't a single day that my mom and dad didn't put everything they had into making that business. So, President Obama, with all due respect, don't tell me that my parents didn't build their business. \nAlmost 45 years after my parents first became Americans, I stand before you and them tonight as the proud governor of South Carolina.\n\nAnd not too long ago, The Wall Street Journal said anyone still thinking the U.S. has lost its manufacturing chops, hasn't been to South Carolina. We have so much potential and so much to be proud of.\nBut like so many states, we have our challenges, whether they be unemployment or education or poverty. And like so many of my governors, I work day in and day out to try and improve the lives of the people of my state. And sadly, the hardest part of my job continues to be this federal government, this administration and this president. \nAs I said, my parents loved it when they came to America. If you worked hard, the only things that could stop you were the limits you placed on yourself. Unfortunately, these past few years, you can work hard, try to be as successful as possible, follow the rules, and President Barack Obama will do everything he can to stand in your way.\nSouth Carolina recently passed one of the most innovative illegal immigration laws in the country. What did this president, who has failed to secure our borders and address this issue in any meaningful way, do? He sued us. If this president \u2014\u00a0\nWe said in South Carolina that if you have to show a picture ID to buy Sudafed, if you have to show a picture ID to set foot on an airplane, then you should have to show picture ID to protect the \u2014\u00a0one of the most valuable \u2014\u00a0And what happened? President Obama stopped us.\nAnd now we come to the most unbelievable of them all. In 2009, South Carolina was blessed to welcome a great American company that chose to stay in our country to continue to do business. That company was Boeing. \nBut we did one of the things we do best in South Carolina: we got loud. \nWe're fighters in South Carolina, and as we fought, we watched an amazing thing happen. You fought with us.And guess what. We won. \nA few months ago I sat on the tarmac at the Boeing facility in North Charleston and watched as a new mack daddy plane rolled onto the runway, sporting a \"made with pride in South Carolina\" decal and surrounded by \u2014\u00a0get ready for it \u2014\u00a06,000 nonunion employees \u2014\u00a0\nWe deserve a president who won't sacrifice American jobs and American workers to pacify the bullying union bosses he counts as his political allies. American businesses deserve a federal government that doesn't stand in their way, not one that tries to chase them overseas. Fighting American ingenuity and innovation \u2014\u00a0that's what this president meant to South Carolina. That's what this president has meant to this governor. And that's why this governor will not stop fighting until we send him home, back to Chicago, and send Mitt and Ann Romney to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. \nI have had the pleasure of knowing Mitt Romney for several years now, and there is so much to appreciate about him. He fixes things. He's results-driven. He's taken broken companies and made them successful. He took a failing Olympics and made it a source of pride for our country. He went into a Democratic state, cut taxes, brought in jobs and improved education.\nOh, and by the way, he actually balanced his budget. \nThis is a man at peace with who he is, with the challenges he faces and with what he intends to accomplish. This is a man, not just a candidate looking to win an election but a leader yearning to return our nation to its greatest potential. And this is a man who has a silver bullet, his greatest asset by far, the next first lady of the United States, Ann Romney. \nAnn is the perfect combination of strength and grace. She does what so many women in America do: She balances in an exceptional way. She raised five amazing boys, battled MS, is a breast cancer survivor and through it all was a true partner to Mitt.\nAnn Romney makes all women proud, by the way she has conducted her life as a strong woman of faith, as a mother, as a wife and as a true patriot. She's an amazing inspiration for me and for so many women across the country. \nNot too long ago I traveled to Michigan to campaign for the Romneys. They are so right.\nWe deserve a president who will turn our economy around. We deserve a president who will balance our budget. We deserve a president who will reform and protect our retirement programs for future generations. We deserve a president who will fight for American companies, not against them. \nAmerica deserves better than what we have today. We deserve a President Mitt Romney. \nThank you, God bless you and may He continue to bless the United States of America. ", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much for that warm welcome. Thank you so much.\nNow, some of you may know the last time I spoke at a convention it turned out I was in the wrong place. \nNow \u2014\u00a0now, we got to get on with the show. We've got to get on with the show because we have a country to turn around.\nThis very night you nominated the most experienced executive to seek the presidency in 60 years in Mitt Romney.\nHe has no illusions about what makes America great. He doesn't confuse the presidency with celebrity or loftiness with leadership. What a difference four years makes. \nNow, America is the land of second chances, and I gather in this close race you have room for the estimated 6 million of us who got it wrong in 2008 and who want to fix it. Maybe the Hollywood stars and the glamor blinded us a little. You thought it was the glare; some of us thought it was a halo.\nBut in all seriousness, do you know why so many of us believed? We led with our hearts and our dreams that we could be more inclusive than America had ever been, and no candidate had ever spoken so beautifully. But dreams meet daybreak. The jobless know what I mean. So have the families who wonder how this administration could wreck a recovery for three years and counting.\nSo many of those high-flown words have faded. Remember, my friends, the president saying of negative politics and untrue ads, not this time? Who knew \"not this time\" just meant not unless the economy is stuck and we can't run on our record? \nRemember \u2014\u00a0remember when the president said of his own election, this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal? Who knew the plain English version of it was, Middle America, get ready to shell out 60 bucks to fill up your car? \nAnd in terms of their crown jewel legislative achievement, who knew that when asked, could government conceivably impose a federal mandate requiring middle-class Americans to buy health insurance, whether they can afford it or not, that the Obama answer would be, yes, we can? \nSo this time, in the name of 23 million of our children and parents and brothers and sisters who are officially unemployed, underemployed or who have stopped looking for work, let's put the poetry aside. Let's suspend the hype. Let's come down to earth and start creating jobs again. \nAnd of course \u2014\u00a0and of course we know that opportunity lies outside the reach of some of our people. We don't need flowery words about inequality to tell us that, and we don't need a party that has led while poverty and hunger rose to record levels to give us lectures about suffering.\n\nNow, ladies and gentlemen, there are Americans who are listening to this speech right now who haven't always been with you. And I want you to let me talk just to them for a moment. I know how loaded up our politics is with anger and animosity. But I have to believe we can still make a case over the raised voices. There are Americans watching right now who voted for the president. But they're searching right now because they know that their votes didn't build the country they wanted. To those Democrats and independents whose minds are open to argument, listen closely to the Democratic Party that will gather in Charlotte, and ask yourself if you hear your voice in the clamor. Ask yourself if these Democrats still speak for you. When they say we have a duty to grow government even when we cannot afford it, does it sound like compassion to you?Or does it sound like recklessness? When you hear the party that glorified Occupy Wall Street blast success, when you hear them minimize the genius of the men and women who make jobs out of nothing, is that what you teach your children about work?When they tell you America is this unequal place where the powerful trample on the powerless, does that sound like the country your children or your spouse risked their lives for in Iraq or Afghanistan?Do you even recognize the America they are talking about?And what can we say about a house that doesn't honor the pictures on its walls?\nJohn Kennedy asked us what we could do for America. This Democratic Party asks what can government give you. Don't worry about paying the bills; it's on your kids and grandkids. Bill Clinton took on his base and made welfare a thing you have to work for. This current crowd guts the welfare work requirement in the dead of night and won't tell the truth about it. \nBill Clinton, Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson reached across the aisle and said, meet me in the middle. But their party rammed through a health care bill that took over one-sixth of our economy without accepting a single Republican idea, without winning a single vote in either house from a party whose constituents make up half of this country. \nYou know, the Democrats used to have a night when they presented a film of their presidential legends. Folks, if they do it in Charlotte, the theme song should be this year's hit: Now you're just somebody that I used to know.\" \nMy fellow Americans, when great athletes falter their coaches sometimes whisper to them, remember who you are, to call to their greatness at a moment when their bodies and spirit are too sapped to remember their strength. This sweet, blessed, God-inspired place called America is a champion that has absorbed some blows. But we bend. We do not break. \nThis is no dark hour. This is no dark hour.\nThis is the dawn before we remember who we are. \nSo may it be said of this time in our history, 2008 to 2011: Lesson learned; 2012: Mistake corrected. \nGod bless you. God bless you, Tampa. God bless you, America. Let's take this country back. Thank you so much. ", "Good evening.\nI have the honor of standing before you this evening for one reason: because thousands and thousands of grassroots activists stood united, not for a candidate but for the sake of liberty. \nWe are seeing something extraordinary, something that has dumbfounded the chattering class. It began in 2010 right here in Florida, in Utah, in Kentucky and in Pennsylvania. It continued this summer in the state of Indiana, in Nebraska, in Wisconsin \u2014\u00a0We are seeing a great awakening, a national movement of we the people brought together by what unites us: a shared love of liberty and an understanding of the unlimited potential of free men and free women.\nI want to tell you a love story. It's the story of all of us. It's a love story of freedom. It's the story of our Founding Fathers, who fought and bled for freedom and then crafted the most miraculous political document ever conceived, our Constitution. \nThe Framers understood that our rights come not from monarchs but from God \u2014\u00a0\nIt's the story of the brave Texians in the city of Gonzales. When General Santa Anna demanded that they hand over their guns and the cannon that guarded their city, they responded with the immortal cry: \"Come and take it.\" \nIt's the story of the \"Greatest Generation,\" who rose up to confront the grotesque evil that was the Nazis and who ushered in the greatest ear of peace of prosperity the world has ever seen.\nIt's the story of civil rights pioneers like Dr. Martin Luther King who stood up to the scourge of discrimination and bravely championed that each of us must be judged not by the color of our skin but by the content of our character.\n\u2014\u00a0who stood up against the oppressive evil of communism and demanded: \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\"It's the story of my mom, Irish and Italian, working- class, the first in her family ever to go to college. She became a pioneering computer programmer in the 1950s. It's the story of my father, imprisoned and tortured in Cuba, beaten nearly to death. He fled to Texas in 1957, not speaking English, with a hundred dollars sewn into his underwear. He washed dishes, making 50 cents an hour to pay his way through college and to start a small business in the oil and gas industry.\nMy father is here today. When he came to America \u2014\u00a0el no tenia nada, pero tenia corazon. \nIt's the story of each and every one of you. We are all the sons and daughters of those who risked everything for freedom. And each of us has a duty to pass that same liberty on to the next generation.\n\nAnd yet today many in Washington seem content to saddle our children with a crushing debt and a limited future. We're going broke.\nBut I'm here today with a word of encouragement. Millions of Americans are standing up, saying, we want our country back. \nPresident Obama is immensely talented and a man of deep convictions, and yet his economic agenda is perilous indeed. This election presents a stark choice. We can continue down the road of the Obama Democrats, more and more spending, debt and government control of the economy, or we can return to the founding principles of our nation: free markets, fiscal responsibility and individual liberty. \nUnfortunately, President Obama's campaign is trying to divide America, to separate us into groups, telling seniors Medicare will be taken away, telling Hispanics that we're not welcome here and sending the vice president to preach a message of division.\nIt's tragic how far we've come from hope and change.\nAll of this is designed to distract from the real issues that matter: 23 million Americans struggling to find work, 16 trillion in national debt and government takeovers of much of our economy.\nImagine for a moment if someone surreptitiously charged thousands of dollars on your credit cards, saddling your kids with debts they could never escape.\nMy wife, Heidi, and I are blessed with two little girls, Caroline and Catherine, four and one. When Caroline was born, our national debt was $10 trillion. Today, as the debt clock shows, it's $16 trillion \u2014\u00a0larger than our gross domestic product.\nHow do we turn our nation around? President Obama thinks the answer is more and more government. You are not doing anyone a favor by creating dependency, destroying individual responsibility.\nFifty-five years ago, when my dad was a penniless teenager, thank God some well-meaning bureaucrat didn't put his arm around him and say: Let me take care of you. Let me give you a government check and make you dependent on government \u2014\u00a0and by the way, don't bother learning English.\nThat would have been utterly destructive.\nInstead, my parents worked together to build a small business, to provide for their family and to chart their own future. That's the American dream. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan understand that government doesn't create jobs. Entrepreneurs do.\nTwo-thirds of all new jobs in our economy come from small businesses, and 2.3 million Hispanics own small businesses. And yet this administration has waged a war on small businesses, a war that is costing our future and our opportunity.\nI want to close by asking a few questions, with apologies to Barack Obama. Can we restore the Constitution? Can we retake the Senate?Can we repeal \"Obamacare\"?\nAnd can we defeat President Barack Obama?Stand together with Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.\nRestore the American love story. That, my friends, is change we can believe in.\nThank you, and God bless you. ", "Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks.\nThank you. Thank you. It is \u2014\u00a0thank you.Thank you. Bless you. Thank you.Thank you, Pennsylvania.\nIt is a great honor for me to be here tonight with the love of my wife \u2014\u00a0life, Karen, over here \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0from Florida, and some of our children.\nMy oldest son, John, wanted to be here tonight, but he's a first-year cadet at the Citadel. \nI am a first-generation American. At the age of 7, my dad came from \u2014\u00a0to Johnstown, Pennsylvania, from the mountains of northern Italy on a ship named Providence. How providential that one day his son would announce for president just down the road from the deep mines where his father, my grandfather, mined coal till he was 72 years old. \nWhen my grandfather died, I remembered as a kid kneeling at his casket and not being able to take my eyes off his thick, strong hands, hands that dug his path in life and gave his family a chance at living the American dream. Working the mines may not have been the dream he ever dreamed. I never dared to ask him. But I think his answer would have been that America gave him more than he had ever hoped. America believed in him. That's why he believed in America. \nMy grandfather, like millions of other immigrants, didn't come here for some government guarantee of income equality or government benefits to take care of his family. In 1923 there were no government benefits for immigrants except one: freedom. \nUnder President Obama, the dream of freedom and opportunity has become a nightmare of dependency, with almost half of America receiving some sort of government assistance. It's no surprise fewer and fewer Americans are achieving their dreams and more and more parents are concerned their children won't realize theirs.\nPresident Obama spent four years and borrowed $5 trillion trying to convince you that he can make things better for you, to put your trust in him and the government to take care of every problem. The result? Massive debt, anemic growth and millions more unemployed. The president's plan didn't work for America, because that's not how America works.\nIn America \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0in America, we believe in freedom and the responsibility that comes with it to work hard to make the dream of reaching our God-given potential come true. We believe it \u2014\u00a0we believe it because it still works. Even today, graduate from high school, work hard and get married before you have children, and the chance you will ever be in poverty is just 2 percent. Yet if you don't do these three things, you're 38 times more likely to end up in poverty.\nWe understand many Americans don't succeed because the family that should be there to guide them and serve as the first rung on the ladder of success isn't there or is badly broken.\nThe fact is that marriage is disappearing in places where government dependency is the highest. Most single mothers are doing heroic work and an amazing job raising their children. \nA solid education should be the second rung on the ladder to success, but the system is failing. President Obama's solution has been to deny parents choice, attack private schools, and nationalize curriculum and student loans. Mitt Romney believes that parents and local community must be in charge of our schools, not the Department of Education. \nYet we all know there is one key to success that has helped people overcome even the greatest of obstacles: hard work. That's why work was the centerpiece of the bipartisan welfare law.\n\nBut President Obama's policies undermine the traditional family, weaken the education system. And this summer he showed us once again he believes in government handouts and dependency by waiving the work requirement for welfare. Now, I helped write the welfare reform bill. We made the law crystal clear. No president can waive the work requirement.\nBut as with his refusal to enforce our immigration laws, President Obama rules like he is above the law. \nYet as my family and I crisscrossed America, something became so obvious to us: America is still the greatest country in the world, and with God's help and good leadership, we can restore the American dream.\n\nWhy? Because I held its hand. I shook the hand of the American dream. And it has a strong grip.\nI shook the hands of farmers and ranchers who made America the bread basket of the world \u2014\u00a0hands weathered and worn, and proud of it.\nI grasped the dirty hands with scars that come from years of labor in the oil and gas fields, mines and mills \u2014\u00a0hands that power and build America and are stewards of the abundant resources that God has given us.\nI've gripped hands that work in restaurants and hotels, hospitals, banks and grocery stores \u2014\u00a0hands that serve and care for all of us.\nI clasped hands of men and women in uniform, and their families \u2014\u00a0hands that sacrifice and risk all to protect and keep us free, and hands that pray for their safe return home. \nI held hands that are in want, hands looking for the dignity of a good job, hands growing weary of not finding one, but refusing to give up hope.\nAnd finally, I cradled the hands, the little broken hands, of the disabled; hands that struggle; hands that bring pain; hands that ennoble us and bring great joy.\nThey came to see us. Oh, did they come to see us when they found out that Karen and I were blessed with caring for someone special too, our Bella. Four and a half years ago I stood over a hospital isolette, staring at the tiny hands of our newborn daughter, who we hoped was perfectly healthy. But Bella's hands were just a little different, and I knew different wasn't good news.\nThe doctors later told us that Bella \u2014\u00a0that Bella was incompatible with life and to prepare to let go. They said even if she did survive, her disabilities would be so severe that Bella would not have a life worth living.\nWe didn't let go. \nI thank God that America still has one party that reaches out their hands in love to lift up all of God's children, born and unborn. \nLadies and gentlemen, you know we are stewards of a great inheritance. In November, we have a chance to vote for life and liberty, not dependency. A vote for Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will put our country back in the hands of leaders who understand what America can and for the sake of our children must be to keep the dream alive.\nThank you, and God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you. Thank you. ", "Thank you. Thank you.\nI stand here tonight humbled to share with you the story of a nation, a state and of one man. It is the story of America itself, of courageous, freedom-loving visionaries who believed in the promise of opportunity, rather than the divine right of kings; who dared to dream that anyone could rise above the circumstances of their birth.\nIt is also the story of the great Silver State, \"Battle Born\" Nevada. We joined the Union to help keep Abraham Lincoln in the White House and fulfill the promise of opportunity as he ended forever the scourge of slavery.\nAnd it is my story, the child of working-class Hispanic Americans, who has lived the American dream. The Proverbs tell us: From small beginnings come great things.\nMy father was one of 10 children. My mother and her family lived in a tiny two-bedroom house in the Southwest. Dad worked his entire career as an aviation technician. Mom was a legal secretary who became a teacher. We lived a simple American life.\nWhen I was a boy, my parents brought us to Nevada in search of opportunity. My first job was cleaning sheep pens. In college I worked in a hospital cafeteria. I worked my way through law school. Encouraged by my parents' love for this country, I dreamed of public service. I became a state legislator, a gaming regulator and attorney general of my state. My story could end there, but this is America. And so, in 2005, a simple son of promise was appointed by President Bush and confirmed by the United States Senate as a federal judge. \nI saw in my courtroom the fulfillment of all that our forefathers sought to create: a nation of laws, a nation of due process and merit, and justice for all \u2014\u00a0and, yes, a nation of immigrants. One of the greatest duties I performed was to administer the oath of citizenship to new Americans, immigrants who embody our dream of opportunity and prosperity.\nBut from the federal bench, I also saw a nation beset on all sides by unprecedented challenges. I watched my state's economy falter, stagnate and slide into decline.\nNevadans lost their jobs and their homes. Nevada was hit hardest by the recession, highest unemployment, highest foreclosure rate, highest bankruptcy rate.\nSo like so many, I looked around for help. And what did I find? A president who promised change but turned instead to the same tired strategy of ever-larger government, a president who abandoned hope and embraced only blame. So I stepped down from a lifetime appointment to make a difference.\nI ran for governor, was elected. And like Republicans all across this nation, I chose to make the tough decisions on issues like economic development, education reform and redesigning how state government operates, on job creation and reducing state spending and eliminating red tape. It hasn't been easy, and we're not through it yet. But I put my faith in the people of my great state because they are the ones who will grow our economy. \nNow, I've seen Hispanic business owners and families from backgrounds not unlike my own struggle in this economy. I have seen young children from all walks of life begin to wonder if their future holds any hope at all. Make no mistake: The current administration's failed experiment with big government gets in the way of economic recovery. Their love affair with government regulation is a drag on business confidence.\nFrom personal experience, I can tell you what will help states like Nevada and families like mine.\nMORE PAGE 4 08/28/2002 .STX fetime appointment to make a difference.\nI ran for governor, was elected. And like Republicans all across this nation, I chose to make the tough decisions on issues like economic development, education reform and redesigning how state government operates, on job creation and reducing state spending and eliminating red tape. It hasn't been easy, and we're not through it yet. But I put my faith in the people of my great state because they are the ones who will grow our economy. \nNow, I've seen Hispanic business owners and families from backgrounds not unlike my own struggle in this economy. I have seen\nx x x decline. Nevadans lost their jobs and their homes. Nevada was hit hardest by the recession, highest unemployment, highest foreclosure rate, highest bankruptcy rate.\nSo like so many, I looked around for help. And what did I find? A president who promised change but turned instead to the same tired strategy of ever-larger government, a president who abandoned hope and embraced only blame. So I stepped down from a lP young children from all walks of life begin to wonder if their future holds any hope at all. Make no mistake: The current administration's failed experiment with big government gets in the way of economic recovery. Their love affair with government regulation is a drag on business confidence.\nFrom personal experience, I can tell you what will help states like Nevada and families like mine.\nElect the team that understands how to get America working again. Send Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to the White House. \nNow, this administration sings a siren song that this is all there is. They tell us government is the answer, but we know it's the problem. They tell us we didn't build our businesses, that someone else made it happen. They tell us not to dream, but to settle.\nYou and I know America is better than that. Our national story is one of confronting challenges and winning. We have overcome economic devastation, defeated mighty oppressors and lifted up generation after generation of Americans. We can and we will do it again, for that is our birthright as members of the American family, white, black, Hispanic, Asian, immigrant or descendant of the founding fathers themselves. \nWe must leave Tampa this week on a mission to remind Americans they deserve more than the status quo. They deserve to dream big. We must remind Americans that the promise of opportunity remains unbroken, that every person in this great nation can succeed through hard work, courage and personal responsibility, for that is the real American story.\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. \nAnd now I have the privilege of introducing to you one of those Hispanic business owners that I mentioned are struggling in this economy: Mr. Phil Archuletta of the great state of New Mexico. Thank you, Governor, and thank you, Tampa! \nIn 2004, President Bush made it possible for our company to manufacture all the signs for federal agencies. When President Obama came on board, he pushed a stimulus. I believed that my business was going to explode with work. Unfortunately, it didn't happen.\nThe Democrats' Congress and the Obama administration created a new procurement process that harms existing small-business contracts, which devastated my business.\nI pleaded for my congressman and senators, all Democrats, and meetings were arranged with the Forest Service. They all listened carefully. They made promises, but nothing ever happened. Today, I'm barely hanging on with orders from the state of New Mexico, thanks to Governor Susana Martinez \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and the orders that are coming through the Forest Service from very loyal customers. I have heard the same story from other small businesses all over the country.\nPresident Obama talks like he supports small businesses, but his actions are destroying us. His administration is putting us out of business. It is our turn to put them out of office. \nThank you. ", "Thank you. \nOn June 5th, voters in Wisconsin were asked to choose between going backwards to the days of double-digit tax increases, billion- dollar budget deficits and record job loss, or moving forward with reforms that lowered the tax burden, balanced the budget and helped small businesses create more jobs. On June 5th, voters in my swing state were asked to decide if they wanted elected officials who measure success by how many people are dependent on the government, or if they wanted leaders who believe success is measured by how many people are not dependent on the government because they control their own destiny in the private sector. \nJust ask Sandy Breth why that's important. When the economy took a dive a few years ago, she took a pay cut. Not long after that, she lost her job. Today, however, she's working at G3 industries in Mosinee, Wisconsin. In fact, she just received a promotion.\nG3 is one of those companies that added jobs during the past year and now has plans to add even more. The owner told me that he's creating additional jobs in Wisconsin because he likes the way we're moving our state forward, and he's even more committed since the last election. Without our positive changes, he told me, he would not have had the confidence to grow business in Wisconsin.\nImproving the business climate is not only good for small- business owners, it's good for people like Sandy and her family. We need more stories like hers in America because the last couple of years have been, well, pretty tough. Like many places across the country, Wisconsin lost more than a hundred thousand jobs from 2008 to 2010. Unemployment during that time topped out at over 9 percent. But because of our reforms, Wisconsin has added thousands of new jobs, and our unemployment rate is down from when I first took office.\nEqually as important, we improved the economic climate for job creators. Today 94 percent of our employers believe Wisconsin is headed in the right direction. That compares to just 10 percent who thought the same thing just two years ago. Elections have consequences.\nAs was the case in Wisconsin two years ago, too many Americans think our country is headed in the wrong direction. But Mitt Romney understands, like I understand, that people \u2014\u00a0people, not governments, create jobs. With that in mind, my administration is making it easier for people to create jobs in Wisconsin. Our reforms put the hardworking taxpayers back in charge, people like Sandy Breth.\nSadly, the federal government seems to be going in the opposite direction. Nationally, we've experienced 42 consecutive months of unemployment above 8 percent.\nLast month 44 of the 50 states saw an increase in the unemployment rate. More than 12 million of our fellow citizens are unemployed.\nWe need someone to turn things around in America. That leader is Governor Mitt Romney. \nWith this pick, he showed that the \"R\" next to his name doesn't just stand for \"Republican,\" it stands for \"reformer.\" Now more than ever, we need reformers, leaders who think more about the next generation than just the next election. That's what you get. That's what you get from Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.\nNow, in a few weeks, we will celebrate the 225th anniversary of our federal Constitution. Moments like that remind us that what makes America so great, what makes us exceptional, is that throughout our history, in moments of crisis, be they economic or fiscal, military or spiritual, what makes America amazing has been that there have always been men and women of courage who think more about the future of their children and their grandchildren than they did about their own political careers.\n\nLet this be one of those moments. Let this be our time in history, so that some day \u2014\u00a0some day we can tell our children and our grandchildren that we were there, that we changed the course of history for the better. Let us tell them that we helped elect Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to save America.\nThank you. ", "Thank you. Thank you very much. Good evening, my fellow Republicans. Are you ready to elect Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan in 70 days? \nImagine that: We'll have a president who actually knows how to create jobs and a vice president who actually knows what state he's in. \nNow, I don't have to tell any of you this is a tough economy. We all have friends and family and neighbors who've lost their jobs and their homes. Worse, they've lost their hope. And their lost hope is why we need a big change this November. \nThis election is about restoring the American dream. That dream led my grandfather, a poor farm boy, to leave Ireland a hundred years ago and come to Ellis Island to begin his journey of freedom in America. My grandfather could have never guessed that his son would fight for this nation in World War II, that his great-granddaughter would lead a platoon in Iraq and his grandson would grow up a middle- class kid in Fairfax County, serve in the Army and now hold the same job as Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry. What an incredible country we call home here in the United States of America. \nThis nation is powered and defined by the great idea of the American dream. That's an idea that says if you work hard, if you dream big, if you follow the rules and pursue opportunity, the sky is the limit in the United States of America. We cannot lose that dream. \nNow, unfortunately, many Americans are now hurting very badly. Too many Americans are looking for work because this president's policies simply haven't worked. Washington today has a surplus of rhetoric and a deficit of leadership and results.\n\nAnd you know the problems: unemployment over 8 percent for 42 straight months; the national debt, immoral, at $16 trillion and growing; new business startups at the lowest level in 30 years. And now the EPA is the \"Employment Prevention Agency.\" \nThese times call for new leadership to get this great country out of debt and back to work. And the choice is very clear: the status quo of the entitlement society versus a dynamic change to an opportunity society. That's what we need in America. \nWe need a president who will say to a small businesswoman: Congratulations, we applaud your success. You did make that happen. You did build that in America! \nBig government didn't build America. You built America. Small businesses don't come out of Washington, D.C., pre-made on flatbed trucks. That coffee shop in Henrico County, that florist in Virginia Beach, that bakery in Radford, Virginia \u2014\u00a0they were all built by American entrepreneurs with big dreams, not a big-spending government with a wide-open wallet full of other people's money.\nIt is remarkable, in 236 years of the American experiment, what the ingenious people of this magnificent nation can do when they're given the opportunity. Every American deserves the opportunity of a limited, responsible government that performs its core functions well and then gets the heck out of the way.\nThat's when good things happen in the United States of America. \nLook at the results of Republican policies in the states. In states with Republican governors, the average unemployment rate is a full point lower than in states with Democratic governors. It makes a difference. \nWhile the Obama administration borrows now $3 billion a day just to keep the lights on, Republican governors have closed $65 billion in budget shortfalls \u2014\u00a0without raising taxes. \nIn Virginia over the last two years, with Republicans and Democrats working together, our unemployment rate is down 20 percent to 5.9 percent. We've added 151,000 net new jobs in Virginia. We've had nearly $1.4 billion in budget surpluses, and we've done it by keeping regulation and litigation to a minimum, and we haven't raised taxes. \nSo my friends, while the president talks, Republican governors lead. Talk is cheap: Results matter. \nNow, just think what we could do if we had a president who would support us and not obstruct us, someone who has created jobs in the private sector, who understands the economy and who has actually balanced a budget \u2014\u00a0heck, for that matter, somebody who's actually passed a budget. \nWe need President Mitt Romney \u2014\u00a0Our great country can no longer afford the job-destroying policies coming out of Washington, D.C.\nBut we don't just have to hope for change; we can make the change this November. We will lift up and grow the middle class. We will celebrate job creators again. We will restore that great American dream that led my grandfather here from Ireland a hundred years ago. \nAnd now, ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to introduce one of those hardworking job creators that I was just talking about.\nBev Gray is president and CEO of Exhibit Edge in Chantilly, Virginia. Exhibit Edge designs, produces and manages trade show exhibits for small and large businesses and nonprofits. Mrs. Gray and her husband, Mike, who's vice president of the company, employ 20 Virginians. And this year they celebrate 20 years of success in business. And here's the thing about Bev: When she talks about her business, yes, she built that business.\nPlease welcome Bev Gray. Thank you \u2014\u00a0thank you, Governor.\nImagine working every day for four years without a paycheck. I did. I worked while our children, Jessica and Kevin, played and napped. And after I tucked them into bed, I worked. Our first nine months we had one client \u2014\u00a0a client who waited six months to pay us.\nWe sustained our business by Thank you.\nToday, Exhibit Edge employs 20 people and helps businesses grow through trade show marketing. When those businesses grow, they employ people. The president said that business owners didn't get there on their own.\nWell, he's wrong. We risked \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0thank you \u2014\u00a0we risked everything and succeeded because of our hard work and commitment.\nWhat President Obama doesn't understand is that when businesses grow, unemployment goes down and people thrive. ", "\u2014\u00a0there. Thank you.\nPresident Reagan once said, \"There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination and wonder.\" He believed, like I believe, like Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan believe, that the potential for America is limitless. We can and we will overcome any economic challenge if \u2014\u00a0and listen to this \u2014\u00a0if the federal government gets out of the way and if it lets go of the regulatory chokehold that's zapping the air out of our economy.\nAnd it's deflating the spirits of our entrepreneurs. We need a president who will applaud and encourage those who work hard to pursue their dreams, to reach their potential, and in doing so, make themselves and America better and stronger. And that man is Mitt Romney. \nThe history of the state of Oklahoma offers a great example of pursuing the American dream. It was built and settled by pioneers moving west to seek better lives. During the great land run of 1889, thousands of families rushed up and put a stake down on empty plots of land. They built tent cities overnight. They farmed the land. They worked very hard.\nAnd in 1897, eight years after the land run, a handful of very adventuresome pioneers \u2014\u00a0with their own money \u2014\u00a0and listen, it wasn't the federal government's money \u2014\u00a0no! \u2014\u00a0they risked their own money to drill Oklahoma's first oil well, the Nellie Johnstone. And by doing so, these early-day pioneers changed the future and the fortune of Oklahoma forever. And today, Oklahoma is one of the nation's key energy producers and job creators, with an unemployment rate of 4.9 percent. \nNow, President Obama, he wants us to believe that Oklahomans owe that success to the federal government, to the Department of Energy or the EPA or the IRS or maybe even him. Well, Mr. President, we know better. And as in Oklahoma we say: That dog won't hunt.\n\nWe owe these remarkable successes to the imagination and the ingenuity of people like my friend, Oklahoman Harold Hamm. \nToday Harold Hamm is the chairman and the CEO of Oklahoma's own Continental Resources \u2014\u00a0And most importantly, we're going to create even more American jobs.\nHarold's success story is not a one of a kind. It's the American dream, and it has been realized by countless men and women since the very founding of this country. He is just one of the many visionaries and innovators in the private sector that are the true drivers of economic growth and creation.\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, that's what President Obama just doesn't get. He'll tell you if you've got a business, you didn't build that, somebody else made that happen. Well, Mr. President, like who? You think it's the IRS, the EPA or the federal government? Gosh. The president believes that government is responsible for our successes, and that's why his solution to everything is more government, bigger spending, more regulation, more bureaucratic programs like \"Obamacare.\"\nAnd he says his plans are working, but look at the results: 42 months of unemployment, over 8 percent; 23 million Americans out of work, underemployed or even just not even looking for work anymore; a nation that is threatened by nearly $16 trillion of debt; and families that are feeling pinched, not just by a bad economy, but by a president that promised hope and change, and left many Americans with no hope and just change in their pockets. President Obama believes that the power of big government is the key to American success.\nBut let me tell you, Mitt Romney believes in the power of the people. Mitt Romney understands that it's free enterprise and hard work, not the government, that has made the United States the envy of the world.\nAnd by the way, the selection of Wisconsin \u2014\u00a0Paul Ryan to be his running mate \u2014\u00a0\nWell, ladies and gentlemen, the Romney-Ryan team will reverse the tide of decline and promote economic security. They know that it's hardworking American families, not the federal bureaucracy, that has built our great and glorious nation. Mitt Romney is ready to lead. He has the experience. He has the vision. And we will restore America's economy and its greatness. \nI am proud to support his candidacy for president, and as the next leader of the free world, Mitt Romney will make us all very proud.\nGod bless you, and thank you. ", "Thank you. Thank you. You know \u2014\u00a0\nAnd let me tell you why it matters, because it really matters. We need a president who will restore the strength and the power of the American people so we the people can rebuild our economy and so we the people can rebuild the United States of America, plain and simple. \nYou know, we've made real progress in Ohio in restoring confidence, because that's what so much of life is about. And we are setting people free in order to build success. But we need a new partner in Washington. This relationship is just not working. It is holding us back.\nI'm going to tell you our story. I'm going to tell you the story of Ohio and the story of lessons learned. I took office in 2011, and when I came into office, we were 48th in the nation in job creation, 48th. We had an $8 billion budget deficit, the largest in the history of the great state of Ohio, and we had 89 cents in our rainy day fund. Most toddlers have more than 89 cents in their little piggy banks, let alone what was in our treasury. Our credit rating was headed down the drain. And we were \u2014\u00a0we had suffered a loss of 400,000 jobs. And ladies and gentlemen, tonight the greatest moral issue in America today is job creation. We had lost 400,000 jobs, our people were hurting and our families were hurting as a result of the recession. In Ohio, we were following a policy of tax, spend and duck, and that's too much of what politicians do.\nThey want to avoid the tough issues.\nBut when we came into power, with my colleagues in the legislature, we took our problems head-on. We balanced our budget. That $8 billion deficit was eliminated without a tax increase in the state of Ohio. And we could not raise taxes because we were not competitive.\nSo you know how we did it? We did it the way that a family does it. We sat down and set priorities. We eliminated those programs that we no longer needed. And you know, when government people spend our money, they're very wasteful about it. So we went through it and eliminated those things we didn't need, but we prioritized those things that we really did need.\nAnd I'll give you an example. We allowed Mom and Dad to stay in their own homes if able instead of going into a nursing home where the costs were five times as high, and when they're in their own home, they're healthier and happier and, frankly, more independent. And that saved us a lot of money because we made government work better. And that made a heck of a lot of sense for us.\nWe also cut taxes because Ohio needed to be competitive. We were 8 billion And the reason we cut it is so that Ohio could be competitive.\nAnd at the same time, we killed the death tax. We killed the death tax. \nAnd we restored common sense in our regulations. And you know what? We still protect the environment, we protect our families, but we don't over-regulate and kill the job creators in our state. In fact, we want to honor the job creators in our state and work with them because they help our families.\nNow, I want to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, just like what Mitt Romney's going to face, the actions that we took were not always easy, and the actions that we took were not always popular. But you know what? When you get yourself in public service, you must lead and you must do what is necessary.\nAnd I want to tell you the good news of where we are today. I told you a minute ago that when we came into office, we were 48th in job creation. You know where we are today? We're fourth in America in job creation and number one in the Midwest! \nWe went from 89 cents in our rainy day fund to $500 million in surplus \u2014\u00a0a half a billion dollars in surplus \u2014\u00a0from being in the hole. \nAnd you know, I watched in horror as we saw the Italians and the French and the Spanish and the Greeks have their credit downgrade. And I remember the night I watched America's credit go downgraded. But in Ohio, instead of our credit going down the drain, our credit outlook has been improved because it's been recognized that we are managing our finances and creating jobs. \nBut ladies and gentlemen, when over those last four years we had lost 400,000 jobs, in Ohio today we have grown new jobs by 122,000 \u2014\u00a0122,000 families better off.\nBut you know what? The wind is in our face. The president has given us headwinds. President Obama has doubled the national debt. You know, I was the chairman of the Budget Committee when we balanced the budget in '97, and I look with horror up at that clock that shows $15 trillion in the national debt. That's the sword of Damocles hanging over our children's head. And the president is doing nothing about it. In fact, each year he's increasing that by $1 trillion \u2014\u00a0$1 trillion. \nAnd let me also tell you that the president says his answer to these problems lie in this: more taxes. Let's take more money out of the pockets of the American people and send it to, of all places, Washington, D.C. Can you even believe it? We not only need to balance budgets, we need to cut taxes, not raise them, to get on the right track. And his regulations have had a smothering effect on businesses, and it has paralyzed the job creators.\nFolks, this is the wrong philosophy, these are the wrong policies, and we need a new leader. And that is exactly why I am for Mitt Romney for president of the United States. \nYou know, I want to tell you about Mitt. He's a business leader. If there is anything we need in government today, it's people who understand how to create jobs, plain and simple. And the people that criticize folks in business just simply don't get it. They've put in this hole. And Mitt Romney has a history being a great job creator.\nSecondly, he was a great governor. He went from billions of dollars in the hole when he became governor to billions of dollars in surplus when he left, and he went from the loss of tens of thousands of jobs when he became governor to the creation of 40,000 new jobs when he left office. And he did it in \"Taxachusetts\" of all places, OK?\n\nAnd remember this: beyond his work in business and beyond his work in government, he's a natural leader. He took those Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, and took them when they were in peril and headed down the drain, he fixed the Olympics and made every American proud of what he did in Salt Lake City, and built a shinier and brighter America as a result. \nFolks, I want to tell you this: Joe Biden disputes a lot of those facts, but Joe Biden told me that he was a good golfer, and I've played golf with Joe Biden; I can tell you that's not true, as well as all the other things that he says. \nFolks, for the good of our kids \u2014\u00a0I know we're at a Republican convention, but this is not about Republican and Democrat; this is about somebody that's going to get this country moving again, restore the strength of this country, energize the people, set them free in a free-enterprise system. That's what this is all about. It is about our children. It is about our families. It is about our country. And frankly, ladies and gentlemen, it's about the world, because even though they don't want to admit it, they depend on the United States of America to lead and to bring moral purpose to the globe.\nLadies and gentlemen, we got to leave here and march and get to everybody to make sure that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are president and vice president of the United States. Thank you all very much. ", "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Cathy McMorris Rodgers and I'm proud to represent eastern Washington in Congress. \nTonight we're going to do things a little differently. I have the pleasure of serving as your host for the evening, guiding you through the next few hours. And I'm delighted to report we have a wonderful lineup for you. Each speaker will be joining together to send a message to President Obama, and that message is three simple words: We built it. We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it! We built it!Before \u2014\u00a0before I ran for Congress, I worked in my family's business, the Peachcrest Fruit Basket, for 13 years. I worked hard every day, and I can assure you that my family built that business from the ground up. \nToday that hands-on experience guides my decision-making in Congress. Unlike President Obama, I know that small businesses are the true engine of our economy, not big government.\n\nTonight you'll hear a variety of stories from people who work hard every day to build our economy. You'll hear from Jack Gilchrist, the owner of a family-owned metal fabricating business in New Hampshire. A number of our leading nation's governors are with us tonight, the chief executives from states like Ohio \u2014\u00a0\nAnd one of the speakers I'm most looking forward to hearing from tonight is someone who I think we can all agree will make a fabulous first lady, Ann Romney. \nTo close out the evening, we will hear from a dynamic and engaging leader who's really shaking up the way they do business in New Jersey, Governor Chris Christie. \nSo let's get started. Our next speaker is from the Granite State and was elected to the United States Senate in 2010. ", "Wow! Look at our republic at work! Whoo!\nHello, fellow patriots! Woo hoo!\nAs a constitutionalist, I have traversed America, visiting classrooms and town halls from Ohio \u2014\u00a0right there, Ohio! \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0from Colorado \u2014\u00a0where's Colorado \u2014\u00a0come on, Colorado, whoo! \u2014\u00a0where's Colorado? \u2014\u00a0Wisconsin.\nThere you go.\nWhat I have witnessed is the splendor of American ingenuity, the triumph of American tenacity and the goodness of the American heart. And President Obama, I'm here to tell you \u2014\u00a0what am I going to say? The government didn't built it. America's entrepreneurship was fostered by our Founding Fathers' vision of a republic, a small government limited by the Constitution's enumerated powers.\nSpeaking of our republic, when Benjamin Franklin was walking out of Independence Hall after signing the Constitution, he walked out, and a woman approached him and said, sir, sir, what have you given us? And he said, a republic, ma'am, if you can keep it. Yeah. \nI believe the best way to keep our republican form of government is with Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. \nOur Constitution guarantees us a republican form of government in Article IV, Section 4. But our liberal brethren, they don't feel constrained by our Constitution. That's convenient for them. By ignoring constitutional limits, they do whatever they like, don't they? Yes, like grow the government to unbelievable and unsustainable heights, and accumulate historic and catastrophic debt.\nPatrick Henry said, \"give me liberty, or give me death.\" Why? Because Democrats depend on dependence.\nAmerica was not born with a gimme gimme mentality, and American liberty cannot survive with a gimme gimme mentality. America was built with her hands at work, not with her hands out. \nThe torch of American Dream is fueled with the unquenchable desire for independence, liberty and freedom. Free enterprise has paved the way for Americans to earn their own success, and it has created an America that has yielded an unprecedented level of progress. This progress has lifted up humanity to greater heights of living and a greater level of dignity.\nMitt Romney will preserve this exceptional American legacy. \nBarack Obama? Barack Obama will destroy it. Obama is stifling the American dream primarily because it isn't his dream. His dream \u2014\u00a0his dream is not of an independent people. His dream is of a dependent people based upon the failed principles of antiquated government.\nMitt Romney will restore the American dream based on three of our tried and true founding principles. One, God gives us our rights, not government. \u2014\u00a0for the people's voice \u2014\u00a0the people's voice is the republic. And for the republic, Mitt Romney will stand.\nGod bless America. ", "Delegates, alternates, ladies and gentlemen, the convention will be in order. \nYou know, we begin tonight with a fundamental question: Can we do better? The answer, in my view, is obvious: You bet we can!\nYou know, the American people are still asking the question: Where are the jobs? Now, President Obama only offers excuses instead of answers. His record is a shadow of his rhetoric. Yet he has the nerve to say that he's moving us forward, and the audacity to hope that we're going to believe him.\nAllow me to illustrate. You know, I'm what you'd call a regular guy with a big job. I've got 11 brothers and sisters, and my dad and my uncles owned a bar in Cincinnati. I worked there growing up, mopping floors, waiting tables, tending bar. So believe me when I say I learned how to deal with every character who walked in the door.\nSo let's say right now some guy walked into our bar full of guys looking for work, having a tough go of it, and the guy said, well, the private sector's doing fine. Well, you know what we'd do? That's right. We'd throw him out.\nThink about this. A guy walked into our bar full of people paying more for health care, paying more for gas, paying more for everything, and this guy would say: Well, we're better off than what we would have been.\nWell, you know what we'd do. We'd throw him out. \nNow, if a guy walked into our bar full of folks who couldn't tell \u2014\u00a0couldn't tell you the last time they got a raise or their house was above water and the guy said, well, we tried our economic plan and it worked, you know what we'd do. We'd throw him out.\nNow, let's say a guy walked into our bar, and before he could say anything, he overheard a regular telling his story. Turns out this guy ran a small business, got involved in it while he was in school. Then, out of nowhere, his business partner died. They had just one customer. So he fought like hell through sleepless nights and close calls, and \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0thank God, paid their dues, proud of what they've managed to do.\nNow, if a guy walked into a bar and heard that story, and he said, well, if you've got a business, you didn't build that, well, you know what we'd do with him, don't you? We'd throw him out. But, you know, it could have just as easily been the story of anyone who's built something from nothing, no guarantees, no government there to hold your hand, just a dream and the desire to do better.\nPresident Obama doesn't get this. He can't fix the economy because he doesn't know how it was built. So in 70 days when the American people walk into the voting booth, what should we do? We should throw him out, because we can do better. We can do a lot better.\nAnd it starts with throwing out the politician who doesn't get it and electing a new president who does. \nYou know, Mitt Romney comes from a family of builders. His father built houses, built businesses, built industry. George Romney was a can-do kind of guy, and he was fond of the old saying that when things are at their worst, that's just the place and the time that the tide will turn. Well, delegates, this is that time, and this is that place. \nWe're here to preserve this country the same way we built it: by exercising our God-given right to set a new course. So who better to turn this tide than the man who has dedicated his career to doing just that for states, for businesses, for the Olympic Games? President Romney \u2014\u00a0boy, I like the sound of that. President Romney will keep his word, and he'll keep his courage too. He'll keep faith with the idea that government exists to serve the people and the people who built this economy.\nMitt's jobs plan will build a stronger middle class through energy independence, schools where our kids, not the teachers unions, come first, free trade, the path to a balanced budget and an end to the uncertainty and the tax hikes that threaten small businesses. It's a big job, so we're fortunate that Mitt has chosen his running mate as a leader who is second to none when it comes to rooting out and fixing Washington's worst habits.\nWhen I met Paul Ryan 22 years ago, he was a student at Miami of Ohio volunteering on my first campaign for Congress. Soon he'll be our party's nominee for vice president of the United States. Who says this isn't the greatest country on earth?\n\nYou know, they call this America's comeback team. Well, any good comeback needs some true believers. So if you believe that we can do better, if you want your children and our children to have a stronger, more prosperous America, then Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan need your help, because we cannot turn this tide \u2014\u00a0only, though, if all of us are all in all of the time, all the way until the 6th of November. It starts here with a convention that will lead to victory for our party and, more importantly, victory for our people and the great cause of freedom.\nGod bless you. ", "Good evening. In two short months our country faces a momentous decision. We will decide whether to continue our slide into debt and dependence, or whether to restore opportunity and self-determination.\nI believe at this time America's looking for leadership. Americans are searching for substance.\nWe're here tonight because Mitt Romney has chosen as his running mate the first real leader of his generation, a man who can help us believe in America again, and his name is Paul Ryan. \nWe're here tonight as Republicans, united and excited for a Romney-Ryan presidency.I remember talking with Paul when he was weighing his first congressional race, and even at the age of 27, he was a man with big ideas and the courage of his convictions.\nPaul's time in politics has really been a family affair.\nHis brother Tobin helped lead Paul's first campaign. His mother Betty and sister-in-law Oakley knocked on doors and handed out flyers. And now Paul is joined by his lovely wife, Janna, and his daughter Liza and his sons Charlie and Sam.\nYou'll find them in church at any given Sunday and after that watching a Packers or a Brewers game or swapping hunting and fishing stories with family. From his very first campaign, Paul asked voters directly, hire me, and has since always reminded his constituents, remember, I work for you. He never forgets who he works for. And no one has been more diligent and effective in working for the good of Wisconsin and America.\nPaul Ryan has the courage to tell the truth even when the truth is hard to hear. Paul Ryan has big, thoughtful ideas. Paul Ryan has the determination to tackle tough challenges, even those that others choose to ignore. Paul Ryan is the leader we need at this critical moment in our nation's history.\nNow, Mitt Romney believes that. Do we? \nLadies and gentlemen, it is my singular great honor and distinct privilege to nominate my good friend, my fellow citizen of Janesville, Wisconsin, a genuinely good man from the Midwest, Paul D. Ryan, to be vice president of the United States of America.\nThank you. ", "A friend of mine who founded Staples with Mitt once said to me, the incredible thing about Mitt Romney is that he makes everyone around him greater than they were. One of the folks who went on to help Mitt Romney at the Olympics in Salt Lake City said, every day you drove to work, you said to yourself that I owed it to Mitt to be better today than I was yesterday.\nIf ever there was a time that Americans need to be inspired to be better today than they were yesterday, that time is now. Today we come together as a party to nominate a president, a man who will energize and inspire this great country of ours. The time has come for a new day in America, one of more freedom, one filled with more opportunity and jobs, and one filled with a whole bunch less debt. That time has come. That man is \u2014\u00a0\nI have the incredible honor to be \u2014\u00a0to nominate \u2014\u00a0to second the nomination of Mitt Romney for president of the United States. ", "Good evening.\nIn these critical times, America needs a leader. Our economy is stagnant. Our vitality has been sapped. Our confidence is down. We're saddled with a failed presidency, with an incumbent president who has not led.\nAmerica needs real change. And now we are here to affirm a leader that will produce that change. There are many reasons America needs Mitt Romney at the helm. We have 23 million Americans unemployed or underemployed because Barack Obama cannot figure out what makes free enterprise work. \nMitt Romney will get our private sector moving again and will respect the successes of our entrepreneurs who deserve credit because they really did build it. \nIn these difficult times, our nation still depends on others for our energy resources, even though we share the largest supplies of energy in the world, because we have an administration now that shuns those assets and keeps us dependent on fragile foreign supplies.\nMitt Romney will unshackle our assets and lead us to real energy independence. \nWe are also a nation that has seen erosion of our respect around the world because we now have a president who prefers to lead from behind. Mitt Romney will restore our strength, support our friends, face up to our foes and regain honest respect for an America willing to lead. \nMy wife, Nancy, and I have gotten to know Mitt and Ann Romney well. We've developed a deep and sincere appreciation for these two friends and their family. We like them, and we respect them.\nTonight we're all gathered here to put in motion the final phase of our campaign to help an \u2014\u00a0America know them better and to appreciate why our nation needs them as our president and our first lady.\nMitt Romney is a good man. Mitt Romney is a smart man. He is compassionate and generous. He's a great father and a supportive friend. He's been a very successful businessman and an extremely effective governor. Mitt Romney knows how to fix the unfixable and to help people perform to their highest potential. Mitt Romney is the right man at the right time and will be a great leader for our country. ", "Throughout his life, friends, family, businesses, charities, troubled entities and the commonwealth have turned to a leader, Mitt Romney when they needed wisdom, support or a turnaround. Each time, he answered the call and he led.\nMitt Romney, with humility, grace and diligence has succeeded at everything he's done: as a governor with a Cabinet that was 50 percent women, at turning around the scale-plagued Olympics, as a businessman, as a husband, a father, a grandfather and a trusted friend. He is a man uniquely prepared and committed to lead America at this critical point when we can do so much better with the right leadership.\nI am so pleased that this week, the American people are again meeting this man, this leader and seeing what so many of us who have been privileged to know and work with him over the years have always seen. This is a man to admire, respect, love and entrust the leadership of our country.\nI am so deeply honored and so proud to second the nomination of Mitt Romney for the office of president of the United States of America. ", "Greetings from the Commonwealth of Virginia, where the American story began.\nWhat started with entrepreneurs arriving in Jamestown in 1607 and grew with the wisdom of Washington, Jefferson and Madison shaped a nation and the world. Lovers of freedom and liberty, members of all races and religions from across the globe now live and prosper in Virginia, which is one of the best places to live, work, start a business and raise a family.\nOver the past four years we in Virginia have kept the American dream alive by observing the president's policies and doing the opposite. Right? \nNow if re-elected, President Obama would double down on his job- destroying policies. He promises to raise our taxes and hurt working families and businesses.\nHe mocks our right-to-work laws. His budget failure threatens to slash 200,000 national security and high-tech jobs in Virginia. His war on success undermines individual initiative and innovation.\nObama isn't working. President Mitt Romney and Vice President Paul Ryan will. They have a common-sense plan to reward and unleash our entrepreneurs and innovators and put America back to work. They will be unapologetic in championing the American dream.\nNow, in 70 days, let's renew our founding fathers' victory for freedom. Let's guarantee that our children and their children continue this American story of freedom, opportunity and prosperity for all.\nThank you so much, and Virginia, let's keep winning. ", "\nAnd times are bad under Barack Obama and his leadership. The labor force participation is at its lowest level in 30 years, 23 million Americans are unemployed, underemployed or have stopped looking for work. And quite simply, the jobs just aren't there.\nHousehold incomes have fallen and debt has risen. We are paying more for health care and getting less choice. There is a war on young people, a war on paychecks and a war on our ability to succeed. We are working to build our own businesses, struggling to pave our own way, only to learn that, according to this president, we didn't build it.\nBut there is the hope for the change of a new day. Governor Mitt Romney has a plan to get this country back on track, and the Young Republicans are excited. We are ready for government to get out of the way so our job creators can actually create jobs.\nWe are ready for leadership that leads from the front. We are ready for change, we are ready to elect Governor Mitt Romney. Thank you.", "Thank you. I bring you greetings from the National Federation of Republican Women, an organization of more than 75,000 Republican women across the nation. As in every recent election victory, in November, success will depend on our ability to energize and mobilize women voters. \nRecently, our National Federation of Republican Women conducted a survey of more than 8,500 Republican women and asked them what they want from their government. Number one, they want less interference and fewer regulations controlling businesses. Number two, they want the kind of strong fiscal conservative leadership that only Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan can deliver.\nWe hear a lot from the media about the Republicans' so-called war against women. Well, which war? Which women? Is it the 850,000 women who have lost their jobs under President Obama? Or the women whose family household income has dropped by $4,300 since this president \u2014\u00a0\nJoin us in restoring sanity in our government by electing Governor Mitt Romney and Congressman Paul Ryan. Thank you. ", "Well, this is quite a place. I'm just taking a moment to take all this in.\nWhere is the Oklahoma delegation?\nGood afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to be here representing my fellow Republican mayors.\nIn Oklahoma, we think we've made a very real and substantial contribution to this presidential ticket. Janna Ryan, the smart and charming wife of the next vice president of the United States, is from Oklahoma. She and Paul were married in Oklahoma City. And while it's becoming more and more unusual for our best and brightest to leave the state, in this case we're glad it's worked out the way it has.\nWe are enjoying a renaissance in Oklahoma City. It's a renaissance fueled by sound, fiscally conservative leadership, and also a belief that local investment in infrastructure is vital to economic development.\nTwenty years ago, we decided that we can do better, and we have. Today we have the nation's lowest unemployment rate among large U.S. metropolitan cities. And while there is certainly a role in Washington in helping to address our cities' critical infrastructure needs, we in Oklahoma City have chosen to invest in ourselves. We have built quality-of-life amenities that have transformed our city into a dynamic home for smart young people and enterprising businesses.\nOklahoma City was recently named as the most entrepreneurial city in the country, with the most startups per capita. And interestingly, we have not done this by creating large amounts of debt. We did something unique for many of our infrastructure packages: we paid cash. \nToday we are building a community that is more walkable, more sustainable, more affordable and more business friendly, and we are building it with the kind of common-sense economic policies that we need in Washington \u2014\u00a0policies that Mitt Romney will deliver as the next president of the United States. \nThank you. ", "As the elected leader of 250,000 College Republicans on more than 1,800 campuses, I've got one of the best jobs in the country. I get to push back against the bastions of liberalism: America's colleges and universities.\nEvery day I'm thankful to be employed. Yet, unfortunately, many of my peers are not as lucky. Half of my generation didn't get up and go to a job this morning. Many of them \u2014\u00a0in fact, three in 10 \u2014\u00a0have graduated this year and moved back in with their parents. The fact is, we're young, we're focused, we're driven, and we need to be out making our mark on the world. Instead, our generation is having a mark made on us.\nOur country is nearly $16 trillion in debt, a burden placed on our generation's back. We're tired of it, and we're tired of a president and his cronies in Congress being all too willing to kick the nation's fiscal crisis down to our road.\nGovernor Mitt Romney has a plan to get America back to work, to rein in our out-of-control spending, and to get our great country back on a sustainable path. That plan is just what we need.\nAt the end of the day, Barack Obama has failed young Americans. We're out of jobs, we're out of hope and we're out of change. Our generation can do better. My generation deserves better.\nThank you and God bless. ", "Good afternoon. I'm Pete Sessions, a congressman from Dallas, Texas, and the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. I'm delighted to be here with our team, our delegates who every day help sell the fight in every community across this country as we stand up to make Barack Obama a one-term president. \nIn 2008 I declared that we would retire Nancy Pelosi, and the pundits laughed. I traveled the country recruiting community leaders who, like their neighbors, were concerned about the future of America under the Pelosi-Obama regime. Together, we did retire Nancy Pelosi, and we brought common sense to the House by placing the gavel firmly in Speaker Boehner's hands. \nHowever, the fight didn't stop there. The Republican message that won us the majority in 2010 of implementing free enterprise policies that create jobs and repealing \"Obamacare\" will continue to allow each of us to grow our House majority, to take back the Senate and to make Mitt Romney the next president of the United States. \nWe have a diverse group of competitive candidates this cycle also, our lead salesmen that will boost the Romney-Ryan ticket. These candidates, many of whom you will hear from shortly, have the will to win.\nThey are on offense to defeat the big-government Democrats.\nThan you for all that you do to help in our fight to rebuild the American dream. Thank you, and God bless America. Good afternoon. My name is Ricky Gill, and I am humbled to stand before you as a Republican nominee for Congress and a proud son of California's San Joaquin Valley. \nMy parents \u2014\u00a0my parents immigrated to the valley from India and Africa with only their love for each other, a strong work ethic and the enduring desire to pursue their American dream. We all work hard in the valley, and we're proud to live there.\nBut today we face crippling unemployment and foreclosures, even the bankruptcy of Stockton, our largest city. Young people leave or drop out of school to help their families make ends meet. Our friends and neighbors are suffering.\nBut the valley is a cautionary tale of failed policies, not false ambitions. No one in this country dreams of dependency. No one hopes for mediocrity. We are ready again to seize the measure of our ambitions not because the government says we can but because we believe we can.\nWe need a new generation of leadership to chart the path, to fight for policies that create jobs rather than red tape and to help small businesses succeed rather than helping green energy companies fail.\nLike you, we valley folks are tough, independent and faithful, and we are ready to rebuild our American dream. Thank you, and God bless America. Good afternoon. My name is Francisco Canseco, and I represent the 23rd district of Texas. \nMitt Romney and I share a very simple belief: We owe our children a much better future. We owe them a future without high unemployment, without higher taxes and without a crushing burden of debt. Along the nearly 800 miles of U.S.-Mexico border that I serve, farmers, small businesses and families are striving to live the American dream. Whether you are a seventh-generation American or a first-generation immigrant coming to seek a better life, like my parents were, we all want the opportunity to succeed.\nUnfortunately, Barack Obama is burdening us with destructive debt, punishing taxes and rubbing \u2014\u00a0robbing us of the opportunity to succeed. We can ensure our children have a brighter future if we follow this guidance: Un gobierno limitado y con menos impuestos significa mas oportunidad y mejores empleos para un futuro mas prospero para las siguientes generaciones. Con Mitt Romney \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0con Mitt Romney como presidente, lo podemos hacer mejor.\nThe answer is simple. Lower taxes, less government means more opportunity and better job creation for a brighter future for generations to come. We can do better. With Mitt Romney, we can do better as our president.\nThank you.Beyond the rolling hills of the blue grass, within the depths of steep mountainsides, Kentuckians built a coal industry that powers America. But Barack Obama doesn't care.\nCoal provides Kentuckians with some of the lowest electricity costs in America, enabling companies like Toyota \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0to create over 7,000 jobs in Georgetown, Kentucky. But Barack Obama doesn't care.\nThis year alone 2,000 Kentucky miners lost their jobs because of overregulation and Obama's war on coal. For every mining job lost, three additional jobs are threatened, including those at Toyota. But President Obama doesn't care. \nRarely in history has a single industry been so ruthlessly attacked with so little regard for the people it hurts, people like Chris Woods , a young coal miner who took me underground to show me his work.\nChris considers himself lucky. He still has a job driving an hour each way for a 10-hour shift. His paycheck supports his wife, two kids and both sets of parents.\nChris \nChris Hello, North Carolina! \nYou can feel it. Our country is at a crossroads. This election will determine whether we continue on the path of more spending, more debt and economic disaster, or whether we choose real solutions and return to the basic principles of free enterprise and limited government.\nNow, at this critical hour in our nation's history, we can't afford to re-elect Barack Obama, a man who believes that America is the problem. We can't afford to re-elect a man who doesn't understand that it was the hard work and achievement of the American people that made this country great. We can't afford to re-elect someone who believes that our dismal economy is doing just fine.\nAnd in North Carolina's 7th Congressional District, we can't afford to re-elect Mike McIntyre, a man who voted four times to make Nancy Pelosi the speaker and then voted with her more than 90 percent of the time \u2014\u00a0again, more than 90 percent of the time \u2014\u00a0while she controlled the House. We can't afford to re-elect a man like Mike McIntyre, who said about Obama's failed stimulus: In our part of the country, it has worked.\nLadies and gentlemen, let's send Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and their lieutenant Mike McIntyre home and restore America to greatness. \nI'm Richard Hudson, and I'm running for Congress from North Carolina. In North Carolina, we tell the truth. The truth is, you can't support open-ended bailouts and giveaways if you want to create jobs. You can't support \"Obamacare\" and say you want to save Medicare. And you can't support Barack Obama if you want to stop the spending, stop the waste, stop the assault on our values. \nThank you.\nnRICHARD HUDSON: This election is about real people, people who are suffering under the policies of President Barack Obama and his friends, like Congressman Larry Kissell. It's about the woman in Thomasville, North Carolina, who told me she has to support two men at home, her husband, who was laid off recently, and her son, who just graduated from college and can't find a job. And it's about the homebuilder in Monroe, North Carolina, who will take any kind of work just to avoid having to lay off any more of his employees. And by the way, Mr. President, he did build that job. \nThe people of North Carolina are suffering under President Obama, and it's not just time for a change, it's time for the great American comeback. And I give you my word that I'll fight every single day for what's right, because it's not about politics, it's about people. It's about our future. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are right for America. But Barack Obama and Joe Biden, they're just wrong.\nThank you. God bless you. God bless the North Carolina delegation. God bless America. You are here and I am here because we indeed believe in America. We are at a crossroads, and we have a choice to make. We have a president who wants his party to make us all dependent on government. We need leaders who believe in the prosperity that the free market brings.\nWe have a president who tramples on our First Amendment rights to religious liberty by requiring all taxpayers to fund abortions. We need public servants who respect life and our religious freedom. \nWe have a president who is all too willing to lead from behind. We need a White House that will unflinchingly support our strongest ally, Israel. \nWe need a president who believes in America. And we have a people who once again are ready to stand up as we the people and choose for themselves the direction of their beloved country.\nI'm Mark Meadows. I'm running for Congress. With Mitt Romney, we're ready to take back our country. God bless you. God bless America. Thank you. Thank you.Wow. Thank you.\nThank you. My family didn't have much growing up and we lost my dad when I was young. But I worked hard and was able to become a doctor and raise my family in northern Michigan. That was my American dream.\nAlong the way, it never occurred to me to get into politics, let alone run for Congress. But I did two years ago because, like many of you, I was disgusted by what was going on in Washington. They're spending away our children's and grandchildren's futures. Today the American dream is being threatened.\nI know our nation is facing enormous challenges. Unemployment is far too high. We have nearly $16 trillion in debt. It's hard for Michigan families to make ends meet. But I believe we can fix these problems by staying true to what has always made this country great \u2014\u00a0individual liberty, free enterprise and limited government. Thank you. Thank you. People from northern Michigan are tough. \nThank you. May God bless you all. \nGreetings \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0greetings to the Iowa delegation and greetings to all the great people in the state of Iowa. Hope and change were elected four years ago. And where has that gotten us? We have almost $16 trillion of debt. And this White House believes in a tax-and-spend philosophy. We have more doubt, families don't know how much \"Obamacare\" will cost them, and businesses don't know what new regulations will burden them and we have more despair.\nFor 42 months, unemployment has been above 8 percent. We keep waiting for it to improve \u2014\u00a0and waiting, and waiting, and waiting. We don't have to wait anymore. We can do better. And we'll do better by honestly talking about the issues. As I have in Iowa this year, we will continue to talk about big issues this week.\nWe'll talk about a balanced budget \u2014\u00a0we can do better. We'll talk about tax relief for working families \u2014\u00a0we can do better. We'll talk about stopping the regulatory attacks on farmers and small businesses \u2014\u00a0we can do better. We'll talk about protecting Medicare and Social Security for this generation of seniors and the next. Ladies and gentlemen, we can do better.And finally \u2014\u00a0and finally we'll talk about getting government out from in between patients and their doctors by repealing \"Obamacare\" \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0we can do better.\nAnd we will do better in Iowa and across this great nation by electing Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan as the next president and vice president of the United States this November. \nThank you. God bless each and every one of you. God bless the great state of Iowa. And God bless the United States. Thank you so much. Good afternoon. \nHoosiers cherish values, like common sense, hard work and problem solving. And there's a lot that Washington can learn from the Hoosier State. When Indiana faced a massive budget shortfall, we didn't play partisan games. We came together, we rolled up our sleeves, and we turned a billion-dollar deficit into a surplus. We understood that when you have a deficit, spending more money is not the solution. In the face of record unemployment, we understood that more government spending will not create jobs. That's why we passed common-sense reforms that made it easier to do business and create jobs in our great state. I can tell you, as a result, Indiana has been rated as the best Midwest state to do business in, and we are among the nation's leaders in job growth. \nIn the Hoosier State, we proved a very simple lesson: Working together is the best way to solve our problems. And Washington can do the same. By cutting spending, reducing the red tape, we can unleash our small businesses to create jobs. And with Hoosier common sense, we can balance the budget, we can get our nation's economy working again. American workers and American entrepreneurs are the best in the world. \nI'm ready to carry their torch to Washington and to prove there will never be a mountain too high for us to climb. Hello, Montana! \nThank you.\nIn 1984, as a young delegate from the great state of Montana, I cast my vote for President Ronald Reagan in Dallas, Texas. For the past 28 years, I've built businesses and created hundreds of jobs. My wife, Cindy, and I have been married for 25 years, and we're the parents of four great kids.\nNow out-of-control spending, crushing debt, job-destroying regulations \u2014\u00a0they threaten our children's future. We have more government than ever before. Our economy is stagnant. Families are struggling. And the America we love is threatened.\nWashington does not create jobs. The American people do.I'm grateful that six generations of my family have called Montana home. My great-great-grandmother left Norway, and she came to Montana in search of a better future. As a widow with seven children, she homesteaded on the plains of northern Montana.\nOn her tombstone are three simple words: \"Saved by Grace.\"\nThe words \"Saved by government\" would never have crossed her mind. She put her faith in God, not government. \nIn 70 days, our nation faces a pivotal election, and our choice is absolutely clear. We can do better and we will do better when we elect Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.\nThank you so much, and God bless. Thank you. Thank you.\nAmerica's in trouble. If you spend a million dollars a day every day, it would take you almost 3,000 years to get to $1 trillion. We are now nearly $16 trillion in debt. Each day we pay more than $600 million a day in interest on that debt. And we deficit-spend $3 billion per day.\nExcessive regulations choke businesses. Our tax code punishes success, discourages entrepreneurs and stifles growth. President Obama's solution? More government, more taxes.\nThis is not the American dream. Our nation is not just one good tax increase from prosperity. American success hasn't come from czars, Cash for Clunkers, endless bailouts, a limitless government credit card or more taxes for more government. The American dream was built on the sweat and blood of Americans that took pride in personal ownership, in themselves and their country. When times were tough, generations before quietly rolled up their sleeves and built a stronger, more prosperous nation. The government didn't build it; they built it.\nAmerica was built with hard work, dedication to principles and a belief that success was predicated on liberty and ownership. Restoring the American dream will require fiscal discipline, limited government, accountability and a strong national defense.\nWe need to make \u2014\u00a0we need to make tough choices. We need leadership. We need to elect Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan because we need to believe in America again.\nThank you, and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nThe past four years of hope and change have led me to one simple conclusion: Our only hope is to change the current resident of the White House. \nYou see, as a poor kid growing up in a single-parent household in North Charleston, South Carolina, I felt like I didn't have much going for me. But I did have a couple of things: A mom who believed in tough love, and that love comes at the end of a switch \u2014\u00a0and my momma loved me a lot. \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and a small-business owner who was my mentor and taught me that I could think my way out of poverty. He taught me that having a job is a good thing, but creating jobs was even better.\nMitt Romney embodies the same vision for America that my mentor had for me. He believes that the path forward is more important than the place where we began.\nAnd let me close by giving President Obama a heartfelt message from the good people of South Carolina: \"Hit the road, Jack, and you don't you come back no more, no more, no more!\" \nThank you! Hey, hey! \nI am a proud member of the party of Reagan, Romney and Ryan. \nAs a father of six, my biggest worry is that our children are losing their shot at the American dream. Today record unemployment is dashing the dreams of our college graduates. Instead of moving onto their dream jobs, they're moving into their parents' basement. The debt we're passing off to our kids is a shameful legacy. And Obama's big government policies have made this the worst recovery since the Great Depression. This is not a liberal problem. This is not a conservative problem. This economy is America's problem. \nObama's quest to spread the wealth has only managed to spread the misery. We have a better idea. Let's spread the economic growth. \nIf you voted for Obama and you have buyer's remorse, let me tell you: Mitt Romney is the hope, and Paul Ryan is the change. It is a vote for fiscal sanity and responsibility in Washington, and it is a vote to put America back to work.\nLet's get it done. God bless. Hey, good afternoon. Good afternoon, delegates. Hello, Pennsylvania!\nWe heard and we will continue to hear a great deal about health care and Medicare in this election. And that's a good thing. As a cancer survivor, no issue is more personal to me than health care and the strength of our doctor-patient relationships.\nHaving developed and survived a very rare form of cancer that kills 75 percent of its victims within five years, I know all too well the importance of a health care system that empowers the doctor- patient relationship and respects the decisions of the family.\nThere is no greater threat to the health care of our nation and the health care of our seniors than \"Obamacare.\" \nMy district, Pennsylvania-12, has one of the largest concentrations of Medicare populations in the entire country. My opponent, Congressman Critz, voted over 20 times to support \"Obamacare,\" including voting against the repeal of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which empowers not doctors and patients, but bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.\nThere is only one ticket that will defend patients, defend doctors and defend families in this health care battle. There is only one ticket that will save Medicare from bankruptcy, will preserve Medicare for today's seniors and will strengthen Medicare for the future. To repeal, to replace, to restore, vote Romney, Ryan and, in western Pennsylvania, Rothfus.\nThank you, and may God bless America.\nThank you. Thank you. I am proud to represent Arkansas's 2nd Congressional District.\nI'm fighting to change Washington at its core because I know we can do better. Record unemployment, record debt and $716 billion raided from Medicare to pay for \"Obamacare\" \u2014\u00a0we can do better.\nIn Little Rock, we have a company with over 500 miles of pipe ready for the Keystone pipeline. But that pipe is sitting in a stack because President Obama says, you can't build that. We can do better. \nWe can't afford to rehire someone with a bankrupt vision and a failed plan. This moment in history is too big. The security of our children and grandchildren is too important.\nYou know, like a man who's lost but won't ask for directions, President Obama has no earthly idea how to solve this country's problems. Yet he beams with confidence in his uncertainty. And who is his navigator? Joe Biden. Folks, we know we can do better.\nWhen I look at my daughter Mary Katherine \nGod bless you, and may God continue to bless the United States of America. Thank you. \nPlease give a warm welcome to our Senate candidate for the great state of Nebraska, Deb Fischer. Hello. Hello. Thank you.\nI'm not your usual politician. I'm a wife. I'm the mother of three grown sons. I'm a rancher and a small-business owner and a citizen legislator.\nBecoming U.S. Senator was never an ambition of mine. But over the last four years I'd become very dismayed with the record spending, the record debt and the record unemployment.\nThe Obama administration has been out of touch with the American people, and they've driven our country towards the edge of a fiscal cliff. We're on track to become the first generation that passes on fewer opportunities to the next. And that is unacceptable. But it doesn't have to be this way.\nI'm running for the U.S. Senate because I know that we can do better. I've been a senator in Nebraska legislature these past eight years. And in Nebraska, we have an unemployment rate of only 4 percent. How did we get there? Well, hey, we cut spending. We balance our budget every year. And we passed the largest tax relief package in the history of our state.\nAnd most importantly, we got government out of the way, and we let the private sector do what it does best: grow our economy and create jobs. We've done it in Nebraska, and I know that we can do the same thing in Washington because we only have two options left. We can either continue the same policies of the past, or we can begin to make the tough decisions and lead our country responsibly.\nWe have a tremendous opportunity to set our country in a new, more prosperous direction, and it begins in November.\nThank you. Thank you very much, and God bless. Thank you, North Dakota! \nPresident Obama has put America on the wrong track, but my home state, North Dakota, shows a different way forward. We have less than 3 percent unemployment, rising salaries and a budget surplus. \nThat's because \u2014\u00a0that's because we don't burden our job creators with red tape. We understand, just like Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, that small businesses are the engines of our economy. So we get government out of their way and let entrepreneurs build their businesses. We trust the individual, not big government, to make decisions about their money, families and opportunities. This is the North Dakota way, and it works.\nMitt Romney shares an understanding \u2014\u00a0\nThank you, and God bless. ", "To Chairman Priebus and to my fellow Americans who have traveled from every corner of this great country to be here in Tampa today, thank you for the honor of hosting the 2012 Republican National Convention. Your faith and trust in us is much appreciated.\nNow let me tell you just a little bit about my city. We were built by people who worked hard and dreamed big. Immigrant families who came here from Germany, Spain, Italy and Cuba. They were cigar rollers, port workers, cattle rustlers. They were the economic engine that powered Tampa Bay. Today we are a city that represents all that is good about America.\nWe are leading Florida out of the recession. Unemployment is declining here faster than anywhere else. We are one of the fastest cities \u2014\u00a0fastest growing cities in the country. We have been called one of the best cities in America to do business.\nWe are attracting some of the best and brightest young people who want to be a part of our technology industry. We are curing diseases on the cutting edge of science and health care. And Tampa remains proud to be home of MacDill Air Force Base, the headquarters of United States Central Command and United States Special Operation Command. \nI can tell you with certainty that we are open for business and we are ready to embrace all that the future holds. As mayor, I stand here today representing an extraordinary group of law enforcement personnel, fire and police and thousands \u2014\u00a0thousands of local volunteers who have worked hard to make this a good convention for you. Each of them proud Americans excited to be part of the democratic process and eager to tell Tampa's story to the world. I trust you will fall in love with our city just as I do every day.\nHave a great week in Tampa. God bless and God bless America. ", "\nAbsolutely. Thank you, Mr.Chairman.\nWelcome, everyone, to my home state of Florida, and we are so honored to host you. And I am honored to serve as your Republican National Committee co-chair. \nEvery election, we heard that this is the most important election of our lifetime. This election is more than that. This election is the most important election in our nation's lifetime \u2014\u00a0\u2014\u00a0absolutely.\nIn 1775 our Founding Fathers rose up to establish our liberty. Today we need to defeat a president whose actions threaten our liberty. In this way, we are in a similar position as our Founding Fathers. Just as they were called upon, we are being called upon. What they started, what they believed in, we must now defend. \nThe danger for America is already here. It's in the form of the Democrat leaders in Washington. We have a Democrat Senate leader who refuses to meet his moral obligation to pass a budget for our government. \nWe have a president that has bypassed the Senate confirmation process in order to appoint unaccountable czars to make and enforce policies on America's citizens, a president that by his executive action has changed immigration laws, imposed unconstitutional burdens on our states and issued overreaching regulations.\nWe know the problem, America. Their names are Obama, Biden, Pelosi and Holder. What they have done and will continue to do should Obama be re-elected runs contrary to the values we believe in and the principles we stand for. It is our duty as citizen activists of this great Republican Party to fight to restore the values of our founding fathers.\nMy fellow members, this fight is not just about an election, and it's not about our party. Our fight is about our country, and we cannot lose this battle. Our founding fathers made huge personal sacrifices for what they believed in. The time is now for us to do the same.\nI am a proud grass-roots activist, one of many in my state and countless others from across this great country. Today, we need as many grass-roots activists from all walks of life and throughout this great nation to stand with us. The sacrifices we meet and the sacrifices we will make are nothing compared to the sacrifices our children and our grandchildren will face if we don't take back this country on November 6th by electing Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.\n\nWe must take this election house by house, precinct by precinct, city by city and state by state to bring our proud conservative message of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to every voter in America. \nThank you. God bless each of you. God bless our proud military and their families. And may God continue to bless the United States of America. Godspeed. ", "I am thrilled to add Utah's voice in support for Mitt Romney. Let me tell you about the America I know.\nMy parents immigrated to this country with $10 in their pockets and a hope that the America they heard about really did exist. When tough times came, they didn't look to Washington; they looked within. So the America I grew up knowing was centered in self-reliance and filled with the possibilities of living the American Dream. \nThe America I know is grounded in the determination found in patriots and pioneers, in small businesses with big ideas. It's found in the farmers who work in the beauty of our landscape and our heroic military.\nIt's found in the Olympic athletes and every child who looks at the seemingly impossible and says, I can do that. That's the America I know. \nPresident Obama's version of America is a divided one, often pitting us against each other based on income level, gender and social status. His policies have failed us. We're not better off than we were four years ago, and no rhetoric, bumper sticker or Hollywood campaign ad can change that. \nMr. President, I'm here to tell you the American people are awake, and we're not buying what you're selling in 2012. The American dream isn't just my story. It isn't just your story. It's our story.It's a story of human struggle, standing up and striving for more. Our story has been told for over 200 years, with small steps and giant leaps, from a woman on a bus to a man with a dream, from the bravery of the greatest generation to the innovators and entrepreneurs of today, this is our story. This is our America. This is the America we know, because we built it. Thank you. Yes, we did.With \u2014\u00a0thank you. With Paul Ryan \u2014\u00a0with Mitt Romney as president and Paul Ryan as vice president, we can restore and revive that America \u2014\u00a0that American story we know and love. The world will know it, our children will tell it, and our grandchildren will possess it for years to come.\nGod bless America!
